<p>In this year’s issue, we focus on the impact of caring and sharing on
people’s happiness. Like ‘mercy’ in Shakespeare’s <em>Merchant of
Venice</em>, caring is “twice-blessed” – it blesses those who give and
those who receive. In this report, we investigate both of these effects:
the benefits to the recipients of caring behaviour and the benefits to
those who care for others.</p>
<p>There is a wealth of evidence about the extent of caring behaviour
around the world. In the Gallup World Poll, people are asked if, in the
last month, they gave money to charity, if they volunteered, and if they
helped a stranger. They were also asked, in 2019, if they think other
people would help them by returning their lost wallet.</p>
<p>Some key findings jump out of the data.</p>
<p>First, people are much too pessimistic about the benevolence of
others. For example, when wallets were dropped in the street by
researchers, the proportion of returned wallets was far higher than
people expected. This is hugely encouraging.</p>
<p>Second, our wellbeing depends on our <em>perceptions</em> of others’
benevolence, as well as their actual benevolence. Since we underestimate
the kindness of others, our wellbeing can be improved by receiving
information about their true benevolence (see Chapter 5).</p>
<p>Third, when society is more benevolent, the people who benefit most
are those who are least happy. As a result, happiness is more equally
distributed in countries with higher levels of expected benevolence (see
Chapter 2).</p>
<p>Finally, benevolence increased during COVID-19 in every region of the
world. People needed more help and others responded. This ‘benevolence
bump’ has been sustained since then. Despite a fall from 2023 to 2024,
benevolent acts are still about 10% above their pre-pandemic levels (see
Chapter 2).</p>
<p>Benevolence also brings benefits to those doing the caring and
sharing. This works best if the motivation is to help others (rather
than to feel good yourself), if the act is voluntary, and if it has an
obvious positive impact on the beneficiary. All this is shown in Chapter
2, where the usual country rankings of happiness are supplemented by
rankings for benevolent acts and expected wallet return.</p>
<p>There are many ways in which we care and share with each other.
Perhaps the most universal example is sharing meals. As Chapter 3 shows,
dining alone is not good for your wellbeing. People who eat frequently
with others are a lot happier and this effect holds even taking into
account household size. The increasing number of people who eat alone is
one reason for declining wellbeing in the United States.</p>
<p>Another important form of caring and sharing is the family. Latin
American societies, characterised by larger household sizes and strong
family bonds, offer valuable lessons for other societies that seek
higher and sustainable wellbeing. In Chapter 4, we see that happiness
rises with household size up to four people, but above that happiness
declines. Notably, people living alone are much less happy than people
who live with others.</p>
<p>Trends towards increased loneliness are most evident among young
people. In 2023, 19% of young adults across the world reported having no
one they could count on for social support, a 39% increase compared to
2006. However, as we have said, they often underestimate the benevolence
of other people. After a powerful intervention, students at Stanford
University became much happier when given evidence of the kindness of
their peers (see Chapter 5).</p>
<p>The opposite of happiness is despair, which can lead to death by
suicide or substance abuse – also known as ‘deaths of despair’.
Fortunately, deaths of this kind are falling in the majority of
countries, though not in the United States or Republic of Korea. As
Chapter 6 shows, deaths of despair are significantly lower in countries
when more people report donating, volunteering, or helping
strangers.</p>
<p>The degree of benevolence in a country also has a profound impact on
its politics (see Chapter 7). Populism is largely due to unhappiness.
But whether populists are on the left or the right depends on trust.
People who trust others veer to the left, those who do not veer to the
right.</p>
<p>For many people, how to express their benevolence is a serious
question. Where should you donate your money? The logical answer is to
generate as much extra happiness (or reduced unhappiness)</p>
<p>as possible. This means choosing charities that yield the most
happiness per dollar. Chapter 8 explains this method and illustrates it
across a range of interventions. Even in low-income countries, mental
health treatments emerge as an especially effective way of spending
money.</p>
<p>In what follows, we summarise the key insights from each chapter and
encourage you to dig deeper into this year’s report.</p>

id="caring-and-sharing-global-analysis-of-happiness-and-kindness"><strong>Caring
and sharing: global analysis of happiness and kindness</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>People are too pessimistic about the kindness of their communities.
The return rate of lost wallets is far more than people expect.</li>
<li>In 2024, benevolent acts continue to be 10% more frequent than in
2017–19 in all generations and almost all global regions, despite
evidence of a return towards pre-COVID levels.</li>
<li>Benevolent acts and expected kindness both matter for individual
happiness levels (Figure 2.4).</li>
<li>Within-country inequality of happiness has been growing over the
past 15 years, while international inequality of happiness has remained
roughly constant (Figure 2.5).</li>
<li>Expected and actual kindness both reduce the inequality of wellbeing
(Figure 2.6).</li>
<li>The wellbeing benefits of benevolent acts depend on why and how
people engage in them. Both helpers and recipients experience greater
happiness from caring and sharing when they do so in the context of
caring connections, choice, and clear positive impact.</li>
<li>Untied foreign aid is positively related to national happiness in
the donor countries. But, on average, countries with high refugee shares
are less happy, since refugee flows are more often based on location
than invitation.</li>
</ul>

<h2
id="sharing-meals-with-others-how-sharing-meals-supports-happiness-and-social-connections"><strong>Sharing
meals with others: how sharing meals supports happiness and social
connections</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>This chapter presents new Gallup evidence on an understudied measure
of social connection – sharing meals. Given the relatively objective way
in which it is measured, sharing meals is uniquely comparable across
countries and cultures, between individuals, and over time, unlike many
other social indicators.</li>
<li>There are stark differences in rates of meal sharing around the
world. While residents of some countries share almost all of their meals
with other people, residents of other countries eat almost all of their
meals alone. These differences are not fully explained by differences in
income, education, or employment.</li>
<li>Sharing meals has a strong impact on subjective wellbeing – on par
with the influence of income and unemployment. Those who share more
meals with others report significantly higher levels of life
satisfaction and positive affect, and lower levels of negative affect.
This is true across ages, genders, countries, cultures, and
regions.</li>
<li>In the United States, using data from the American Time Use Survey,
the authors find clear evidence that Americans are spending more and
more time dining alone. In 2023, roughly 1 in 4 Americans reported
eating all of their meals alone the previous day – an increase of 53%
since 2003. Dining alone has become more prevalent for every age group,
but especially for young people.</li>
<li>Meal sharing also appears to be closely related to some, but not
all, measures of social connectedness. Most notably, countries where
people share relatively more meals tend to display higher levels of
social support and positive reciprocity, and lower levels of
loneliness.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, there remain vast gaps in our understanding of the
causal dynamics of meal sharing, subjective wellbeing, and social
connections. The authors point to a number of promising avenues for
future research.</li>
</ul>

<h2
id="living-with-others-how-household-size-and-family-bonds-relate-to-happiness"><strong>Living
with others: how household size and family bonds relate to
happiness</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>For most people in the world, family is a source of joy and
support. This chapter explores how the size and configuration of
households affect people’s happiness.</p></li>
<li><p>In Mexico and Europe, a household size of four to five predicts
the highest levels of happiness. Couples who live with at least one
child, or couples who live with children and members of their extended
family, have especially high average life satisfaction.</p></li>
<li><p>People living on their own often experience lower levels of
happiness. People in very large households can also experience lower
happiness, probably linked to diminished economic satisfaction.</p></li>
<li><p>Latin American societies, characterised by larger household sizes
and strong family bonds, offer valuable lessons for other societies that
seek to enrich relational satisfaction and improve overall happiness
metrics and research approaches.</p></li>
<li><p>Understanding the drivers of family happiness requires surveys
that measure their dynamics, interactions, processes, and outcomes.
National statistical offices should prioritise the development of
metrics that assess the quantity and quality of interpersonal
relationships and the bonds that underpin them.</p></li>
<li><p>Public policies should consider how economic decisions may have
secondary effects on relationships, hence affecting the wellbeing of
families.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
id="connecting-with-others-how-social-connections-improve-the-happiness-of-young-adults"><strong>Connecting
with others: how social connections improve the happiness of young
adults</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Social connections are vital for the wellbeing of young adults as
they provide a buffer from the toxic effects of stress.</li>
<li>However, social disconnection is quite prevalent among young adults.
In 2023, 19% of young adults across the world reported having no one
that they could count on for social support, representing a 39% increase
compared to 2006.</li>
<li>Early social ties during young adulthood have long-lasting effects.
For university students, friendships formed in the first few weeks of
college increase the likelihood of flourishing and reduce the likelihood
of developing depressive symptoms over the subsequent years.</li>
<li>Many young adults underestimate their peers’ empathy, leading them
to avoid connecting with others and missing out on opportunities for
meaningful relationships.</li>
<li>Fortunately, there are interventions that can bridge this ‘empathy
perception gap’ by informing young adults about the empathy of their
peers. Undergraduate students who were exposed to these interventions
saw others as more empathic and were more likely to make new connections
and build larger social networks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h2>
<h2
id="supporting-others-how-prosocial-behaviour-reduces-deaths-of-despair"><strong>Supporting
others: how prosocial behaviour reduces deaths of despair</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Increasing prosocial behaviour (donating, volunteering, and helping
strangers) is connected to decreasing deaths of despair around the
world. Regression results indicate that a ten percentage-point increase
in the share of people engaging in prosocial behaviour is associated
with approximately 1 fewer death per year per 100,000.</li>
<li>Deaths of despair have declined since 2000 in 75% of 59 countries.
The largest declines occurred in northeastern Europe, from very high
initial levels, but deaths of despair are still high and rising in a few
countries including the United States and Republic of Korea. In 2019,
Slovenia had the highest level, with more than 50 deaths per
100,000.</li>
<li>Deaths of despair are nearly four times higher among men than women,
and more than double among those aged 60+ compared with those aged
15–29. Three-quarters are due to suicide, followed by deaths due to
alcohol and drug abuse.</li>
<li>Previous research indicates that prosocial behaviour contributes to
individual wellbeing. This chapter further demonstrates that increasing
prosocial behaviour is reliably connected to decreasing deaths of
despair. Societies could benefit from investing in the conditions
supporting prosocial behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<h2
id="trusting-others-how-unhappiness-and-social-distrust-explain-populism"><strong>Trusting
others: how unhappiness and social distrust explain
populism</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Subjective experiences like life satisfaction and trust play a much
greater role in shaping values and voting behaviour than traditional
ideologies or class struggle.</li>
<li>In Europe and the United States, the decline in happiness and social
trust explains a large share of the rise in political polarisation and
votes against ‘the system’.</li>
<li>The decline in life satisfaction explains the overall rise in
anti-system votes but trust in others then comes into play. Among
unhappy people attracted by the extremes of the political spectrum,
low-trust people are more often found on the far right, whereas
high-trust people are more inclined to vote for the far left.</li>

<h2
id="giving-to-others-how-to-convert-your-money-into-greater-happiness-for-others"><strong>Giving
to others: how to convert your money into greater happiness for
others</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>The authors estimate how much happiness per dollar is created by
specific forms of charitable expenditure. Happiness is measured in
wellbeing-years (WELLBYs).</li>
<li>They find that the wellbeing cost-effectiveness of charities varies
dramatically. The best charities in their sample are hundreds of times
better at increasing happiness than others. This implies that donors can
multiply their impact, <em>at no extra cost</em>, by funding the most
cost-effective charities.</li>
<li>A key gap in the evidence is the lack of well-being evaluations for
large, well-known charities. The authors discuss the challenges in
evaluating large charities and explain why they have questions about the
impact of these organisations.</li>
<li>To conclude, the authors set out directions for how to improve the
new discipline of wellbeing cost-effectiveness analysis.</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="our-new-results-on-caring-and-sharing"><strong>Our new results
on caring and sharing</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>During 2024, the COVID-era surge in benevolent acts fell
significantly but remains more than 10% higher than 2017–19 levels
almost everywhere.</li>
<li>In 2024, helping strangers remains significantly higher than in
2017–19 in all global regions, by a global average of 18%.</li>
<li>Expecting kindness from others is a stronger predictor of happiness
than major actual or expected harms (Figure 2.4).</li>
<li>People are too pessimistic about the kindness of their communities.
The return rate of lost wallets is much higher than people expect,
especially in the Nordic countries, which have the highest rates of both
expected and actual wallet returns.</li>
<li>Engaging in benevolent acts and expecting kindness from others both
matter for individual happiness levels. The effect of expected wallet
return is almost twice as large as for the frequency of benevolent acts
(Figure 2.4).</li>
<li>Across countries, expected wallet return significantly predicts the
return of wallets dropped in experiments.</li>
<li>Happiness inequality within countries has increased by about
one-quarter over the past two decades, while happiness inequality
between countries has remained roughly constant (Figure 2.5).</li>
<li>Expected fairness and kindness reduce happiness inequality and add
to the benefits of trust and social connections (Figures 2.6 and
2.7).</li>
<li>On average, countries that provide more untied official development
assistance (ODA) are happier. Countries with high refugee population
shares are less happy, as refugee flows are more often based on location
than invitation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-the-stage"><strong>Setting the stage</strong></h2>
<p>In <em>World Happiness Report 2024</em>, we studied happiness by age
group and birth cohort, finding contrasting patterns in different parts
of the world. We also continued to show how three types of benevolent
acts – donating, volunteering, and helping strangers – changed during
the COVID-19 years. We previously found a global surge in benevolent
acts during 2020, led by the helping of strangers, which continued
through subsequent years. Last year, we found these acts to be prevalent
in all generations, especially among Millennials and Gen Z. We suggested
that this upsurge of benevolent acts might have led people to feel
better about themselves and their neighbours. These positive wellbeing
effects appear to have offset the negative effects felt by many of those
whose lives were changed, endangered, and sometimes harmed during the
pandemic.</p>
<p>We also found that feelings of social support were twice as common as
feelings of loneliness and had larger connections to life evaluations.1
In <em>World Happiness Report 2021</em>, we found that people who felt
others in their communities were watching their backs and would return a
lost wallet were far happier with their lives. Seeing kindness in one’s
community provides a greater happiness boost than the absence of violent
crime, mental illness, or having a much higher income. These findings,
along with the relative stability of life evaluations during COVID-19,
led us to dig deeper into these questions.</p>
<p>This year, we present several strands of evidence on our theme of
caring and sharing. First, we deliver our usual rankings of nations in
terms of the average life evaluations of their residents, along with our
modelling of how differences across countries and over time are
connected to a variety of life circumstances and the prevalence of
positive and negative emotions. The main life circumstances we consider
continue to be GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, having someone
to count on, having a sense of freedom to make key life decisions,
average frequency of donations,2 and perceptions of corruption in
government and business.</p>
<p>Next, we present rankings (using 2022–2024 data) for the three
benevolent acts covered in every Gallup World Poll plus national
perceptions, from the 2019 Lloyd’s Register Foundation World Risk Poll,
of the likelihood of the return of a lost wallet if found by: (a) a
neighbour, (b) a stranger, or (c) a police officer. As we shall see,
each of these three wallet questions captures different aspects of
society. The benevolence of neighbours represents the local social
context, while expected wallet return by strangers reflects the broader
social fabric. The expectation of wallet return by a police officer
captures the perceived honesty and benevolence of an important public
institution. We later track time trends of the three Gallup World Poll
benevolence measures from 2006 through 2024.</p>
<p>We then survey the large literature that considers the conditions
under which benevolent acts are likely to be of more benefit to givers
and receivers. In doing so, we present evidence on the link between
individual benevolent actions, wellbeing, and the social context.</p>
<p>Another central social issue relates to the distribution of
wellbeing. We have previously shown that within-country inequality of
wellbeing has been increasing over the past twenty years and that this
inequality is less in high-trust environments. This year, we show how
living in a society believed to be benevolent mitigates the harmful
effects of unfortunate circumstances and thereby reduces the inequality
of wellbeing.</p>
<p>Finally, we report on the extent of international caring and sharing
and its possible linkages to national happiness. We consider both the
levels of official development assistance and each country’s population
share of refugees.</p>
<h4 id="box-2.1-measuring-subjective-wellbeing"><strong>Box 2.1:
Measuring subjective wellbeing</strong></h4>
<p>Our measurement of subjective wellbeing continues to rely on three
main wellbeing indicators: life evaluations, positive emotions, and
negative emotions (with the last two often referred to as positive and
negative affect). Our happiness rankings are based on life evaluations,
as the more stable measure of the quality of people’s lives.</p>
<h4 id="life-evaluations"><strong>Life evaluations</strong></h4>
<p>The Gallup World Poll, which remains the principal source of data in
this report, asks respondents to evaluate their current life as a whole
using the image of a ladder, with the best possible life for them as a
10 and the worst possible as a 0. Each respondent provides a numerical
response on this scale, referred to as the Cantril Ladder. Typically,
around 1,000 responses are gathered annually for each country. Weights
are used to construct population-representative national averages for
each year in each country. We base our happiness ranking on a threeyear
average of these life evaluations since the larger sample size enables
more precise estimates.</p>
<h4 id="positive-emotions"><strong>Positive emotions</strong></h4>
<p>Positive affect is given by the average of individual yes or no
answers about three positive emotions: laughter, enjoyment, and interest
(for details see Box 2.2).</p>
<h4 id="negative-emotions"><strong>Negative emotions</strong></h4>
<p>Negative affect is given by the average of individual yes or no
answers about three negative emotions: worry, sadness, and anger.</p>
<h4 id="comparing-life-evaluations-and-emotions"><strong>Comparing life
evaluations and emotions</strong></h4>
<p>Life evaluations provide the most informative measure for
international comparisons because they capture quality of life in a more
complete and stable way than emotional reports based on daily
experiences.</p>
<p>Life evaluations vary more between countries than emotions and are
better explained by the diverse life experiences in different countries.
Emotions yesterday are well explained by events of the day being asked
about, while life evaluations more closely reflect the circumstances of
life as a whole. In Table 2.1, we show that emotions are significant
supports for life evaluations.</p>
<p>Positive emotions are still more than twice as frequent as negative
emotions, even during the years since the onset of COVID-19.</p>
<h2 id="happiness-ranking"><strong>Happiness ranking</strong></h2>
<p>Countries are ranked according to their selfassessed life evaluations
averaged over the years 2022–2024.3 The overall length of each country
bar in Figure 2.1 represents the average response to the Cantril Ladder
question in the Gallup World Poll. The confidence intervals for each
country’s average life evaluation are shown by horizontal whiskers at
the right-hand end of each country bar. Confidence intervals for each
country’s rank are displayed in brackets to the right of the rank
number.4 These ranking ranges are wider where</p>
<p>there are many countries with similar averages and for countries with
smaller sample sizes.5</p>
<p>Figure 2.1 includes colour-coded sub-bars in each country row
representing the extent to which six key variables contribute to
explaining life evaluations. These variables (described in more detail
in Box 2.2) are log GDP per capita, social support, healthy life
expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption. As already noted, our
happiness rankings are <em>not</em> based on any index of these six
factors. Rather, rankings are based on individuals’ assessments of their
own lives, in</p>
<p>particular their answers to the single-item Cantril Ladder life
evaluation question. We use observed data on the six variables and
estimates of their associations with life evaluations to help explain
the variation of life evaluations across countries, much as
epidemiologists estimate the extent to which life expectancy is affected
by factors such as smoking, exercise, and diet.</p>
<p>Each of the country bars in Figure 2.1 is divided into seven
segments, showing our research efforts to find possible sources for the
ladder levels. The first six sub-bars show how much each of the six key
variables is calculated to contribute to that country’s ladder score,
relative to that in a hypothetical country called ‘Dystopia’, so named
because it has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for
2022–2024 for each of the six key variables used in Table 2.1. We use
Dystopia as a benchmark against which to compare contributions from each
of the six factors. The choice of Dystopia as a benchmark permits every
real country to have a positive (or at least zero) contribution from
each of the six factors. We calculate, based on the estimates in the
first column of Table 2.1, that Dystopia had a 2022– 2024 ladder score
equal to 1.37 on the 0–10 scale. The final sub-bar is the sum of two
components: the calculated average 2022–2024 life evaluation in Dystopia
(= 1.37) and each country’s own prediction error, which measures the
extent to which life evaluations are higher or lower than predicted by
our equation in the first column of Table 2.1. These residuals are as
likely to be negative as positive.</p>
<h4
id="consistency-and-change-in-happiness-rankings"><strong>Consistency
and change in happiness rankings</strong></h4>
<p>Two features carry over from previous editions of the World Happiness
Report. First, there is still a lot of year-to-year consistency in the
way people rate their lives in different countries. Since our rankings
are based on a three-year average, there is information carried forward
from one year to the next. The effects of cataclysmic events depend on
when the survey took place and are muted by the three-year
averaging.</p>
<p>Second, there remains a large gap between the top and bottom
countries – more than six points (on a 0–10 scale) between Finland at
the top and Afghanistan at the bottom. The top countries are more
tightly grouped than the bottom ones. The top twenty have a spread of
less than one point on the 0–10 scale, with the corresponding spread
among the bottom twenty being three times as great. The remaining
100-odd countries cover the remaining 2.3 points of the total range.
This means that relatively modest changes in a national average can lead
to a large shift in rank, as illustrated by 95% confidence regions of
more than 25 ranks for several countries in the middle of the global
list.</p>
<p>Happiness scores are based on the resident populations in each
country, rather than their citizenship or place of birth. In <em>World
Happiness Report 2018</em>, we split the responses between the locally-
and foreign-born populations in each country and found the happiness
rankings to be essentially the same for the two groups.6 There was some
source-country effect after migration and some tendency for migrants to
move to happier countries so that, among the 20 happiest countries in
that report, the average happiness for the locally-born was about 0.2
points higher than the foreign-born.</p>
<p>Nordic countries once again lead the happiness rankings. Finland,
Denmark, Iceland and Sweden are still the top four and in the same
order. The confidence intervals for the rankings show Finland still in a
group by itself, with Denmark and Iceland following in a group of two,
and Sweden in a range that runs from 4 to 8.</p>
<p>If we compare this year’s top-ranking countries with those in the
2013 report – the first to assign rankings based on three-year averages
– we find 14 western industrial countries in the top 20 in both years.
In 2013, these countries were accompanied by four from Latin America and
one from the Middle East. Reflecting the long-term convergence between
Eastern and Western Europe, three of the top 20 countries in 2025 are
from Central and Eastern Europe (Lithuania at 16, Slovenia at 19, and
Czechia at 20). This year’s top 20 also includes two countries from
Latin America (Costa Rica at 6 and Mexico at 10) and one from the Middle
East (Israel at 8). In 2013, the top ten countries were all western
industrial countries but now only seven are. As a group,</p>
<p><img src="_page_18_Figure_3.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_19_Figure_3.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_20_Figure_2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>the five Nordic countries have improved their positions in the top
ten, with an average rank of 4.8 in 2013 rising to 3.4 in 2025. This
increase is driven mainly by Finland (from 7 to 1) and Iceland (from 9
to 3). The industrial countries pushed out of the top ten between 2013
and 2025 include Switzerland (3 in 2013, 1 in 2015, and 13 in 2025),
Canada (6 in 2013 and 18 in 2025), and Australia (10 in 2013 and 11 in
2025). This year, for the first time, none of the large industrial
powers ranked in the top 20.</p>
<p>For the least happy countries, ranks are not so easily compared since
there were 156 countries ranked in 2013 compared to 147 this year. Togo
was the least happy country in 2013 and has since risen twenty places,
with an average life evaluation almost 1.4 points higher now than then.
Afghanistan has gone in the reverse direction with a drop of almost 2.7
points between 2013 and 2025. The average life evaluation is now 1.36,
by far the lowest average score ever seen in all our reports.
Furthermore, life is especially difficult for Afghan women, as their
average is only 1.16 points.7</p>
<p>In the middle and lower sections of the rankings, it is more
meaningful to look at average life evaluations, because a country’s rank
can change many places with only a small change in average life
evaluation. That is why, when we consider changes in happiness, we
consider how current average life evaluations compare with those during
the first years of the Gallup World Poll (2005–2010). Tables 24 to 26 in
the online statistical appendix measure the change in average life
evaluations from the 2005–2010 base period to the current ranking
period, 2022–2024. The top five gainers are all in Central and Eastern
Europe: Serbia, Bulgaria, Georgia, Latvia, and Romania. Of the 19
countries that have gained a point or more on the 0–10 scale, 12 are
Central and Eastern Europe, reflecting the European happiness
convergence that has been clear for more than a decade. Other big
gainers include Togo and Congo in Africa; China, Mongolia, the
Philippines and Viet Nam in Asia; and Nicaragua in Latin America.</p>
<p>There are, fortunately, fewer countries whose life evaluations have
fallen by more than one point on the 0–10 scale. Going from the largest
to the</p>
<p><em>In general, the western industrial countries are now less happy
than they were between 2005 and 2010.</em></p>
<p>smallest drops in life evaluations, these seven countries are
Afghanistan, Lebanon, Jordan, Malawi, Venezuela, Egypt and Botswana.
These are mainly countries in or near zones of major conflict.</p>
<p>In general, the western industrial countries are now less happy than
they were between 2005 and 2010. Fifteen of them have had significant
drops, compared to four with significant increases.<sup>8</sup> Three
western countries had drops exceeding 0.5 on the 0–10 scale (the United
States, Switzerland, and Canada) putting them among the fifteen largest
losers.</p>
<p>Among the 136 countries included in the 2005–2010 and 2022–2024 data,
there are 67 with statistically significant gains9 and 42 with
significant drops in their life evaluations.<sup>10</sup> Those with
significant drops include western industrialised countries with
previously, and even currently, high rankings.</p>
<p>The rankings for positive emotions are shown in Tables 66–68 of the
online statistical appendix. The top ten include six from Latin America,
three from Southeast Asia, and one from Africa. The lowest frequency of
positive emotions is in Afghanistan. It also has the most frequent
negative emotions. In the top ten for negative emotions it is joined by
three Middle Eastern countries, five African countries, and Armenia (see
Tables 69–71 of the online statistical appendix).</p>
<h4 id="why-do-happiness-levels-differ"><strong>Why do happiness levels
differ?</strong></h4>
<p>In Table 2.1, we present our latest modelling of national average
life evaluations and measures of positive and negative emotions (often
referred to as positive and negative affect) by country and year.11 The
results in the first column explain national average life evaluations in
terms of six key variables: log GDP per capita, healthy life</p>
<p>expectancy, having someone to count on, freedom to make life choices,
generosity, and freedom from corruption.12 Taken together, these six
variables explain more than three-quarters of the variation in life
evaluations across countries and years, using data from 2005 through
2024.13</p>
<p>The six variables were originally chosen as the best available
measures of factors established in both experimental and survey data as
having significant links to subjective wellbeing, and especially to life
evaluations.14 The explanatory</p>
<p>power of the unchanged model has gradually increased as we have added
more years to the sample, which is now almost three times as large as
when the equation was first introduced in <em>World Happiness Report
2013</em>. We keep looking for possible improvements when and if new
evidence becomes available.15 The number of years of data is now great
enough that we can experiment with including country fixed effects, as
shown in Table 10 of the online statistical appendix. The results are
remarkably similar.16</p>
<p><img src="_page_22_Picture_4.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_23_Picture_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>The second and third columns of Table 2.1 use the same six variables
to estimate equations for national averages of positive and negative
affect, where both are based on answers about yesterday’s emotional
experiences (Box 2.2 explains how these measures are constructed). In
general, emotional measures, especially negative ones, are differently
and much less fully explained by the six variables than are life
evaluations. GDP per capita and healthy life expectancy have significant
effects on life evaluations,17 but not, in these national average data,
on positive emotions.18 However, the social variables do have
significant effects on both positive and negative emotions. Bearing in
mind that positive and negative emotions are measured on a 0–1 scale,
while life evaluations are on a 0–10 scale, having someone to count on
can be seen to have similar proportionate effects on positive and
negative emotions as it does on life evaluations. Freedom and generosity
have even larger associations with positive emotions than with the
Cantril Ladder. Negative emotions are significantly reduced by social
support, a sense of freedom, and the absence of corruption.</p>
<p>In the fourth column, we re-estimate the life evaluation equation
from column 1, adding both positive and negative emotions to partially
implement the Aristotelian presumption that sustained positive emotions
are important supports for a good life.19 The results continue to
buttress a finding in psychology that the existence of positive emotions
matters more than the absence of negative ones when predicting either
longevity20 or resistance to the common cold.21 Consistent with this
evidence, we find that positive affect has a large and highly
significant impact in the final equation of Table 2.1, while negative
affect has none.</p>
<p>As for the coefficients on the other variables in the fourth column,
the changes are substantial only on those variables – especially freedom
and generosity – that have the largest impacts on positive affect. Thus,
we can infer that positive emotions play a strong role in supporting
life evaluations and that much of the impact of freedom and generosity
on life evaluations is channelled through their influence on positive
emotions. That is, freedom and generosity have large impacts on positive
affect, which in turn has a major impact on life evaluations.</p>

<h4 id="box-2.2-explaining-the-variables-in-table-2.1"><strong>Box 2.2:
Explaining the variables in Table 2.1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>GDP per capita</strong> is in terms of Purchasing Power
Parity (PPP) adjusted to constant 2021 international dollars, taken from
the World Development Indicators (WDI) by the World Bank (version 34,
last updated on 28 October 2024). See the online statistical appendix
for more details. GDP data for 2024 are not yet available, so we extend
the GDP time series from 2023 to 2024 using country-specific forecasts
of real GDP growth from the OECD Economic Outlook No. 116 (Edition
2024/2) or, if missing, from the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects
(last updated: 11 June 2024), after adjustment for population growth.
The equation uses the natural log of GDP per capita as this form fits
the data significantly better than GDP per capita.</p>
<p>The time series for <strong>healthy life expectancy</strong> at birth
are constructed based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO)
Global Health Observatory data repository, with data available up to
2021 (last updated: 2 August 2024). To match this report’s sample period
(2005–2024), interpolation (when necessary) and extrapolation are used.
See the online statistical appendix for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Social support</strong> is the national average of the binary
responses (0=no, 1=yes) to the Gallup World Poll (GWP) question “If you
were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to
help you whenever you need them, or not?”</p>
<p><strong>Freedom to make life choices</strong> is the national average
of binary responses to the GWP question “Are you satisfied or
dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your
life?”</p>
<p><strong>Generosity</strong> is the residual from regressing the
national average of GWP responses to the donation question “Have you
donated money to a charity in the past month?” on log GDP per
capita.</p>
<p><strong>Perceptions of corruption</strong> is the average of binary
answers to two GWP questions: “Is corruption widespread throughout the
government or not?” and “Is corruption widespread within businesses or
not?” Where data for government corruption are missing, the perception
of business corruption is used as the overall corruption-perception
measure.</p>
<p><strong>Positive affect</strong> is defined as the average of
previous-day affect measures for laughter, enjoyment, and doing
interesting things. The inclusion of doing interesting things (first
added for World Happiness Report 2022) gives us three components in each
of positive and negative affect, and slightly improves the equation fit
in column 4. The general form for the affect questions is: “Did you
experience the following feelings during a lot of the day yesterday?”
See the online statistical appendix for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Negative affect</strong> is defined as the average of
previous-day affect measures for worry, sadness, and anger.</p>
<p>The variables we use in our Table 2.1 modelling may be taking credit
properly due to other variables or unmeasured factors. There are also
likely to be vicious or virtuous circles, with two-way linkages among
the variables. For example, there is much evidence that those who have
happier lives are likely to live longer,22 be</p>
<p>more trusting and cooperative, and generally better able to meet
life’s demands.23 This will double back to improve health, income,
generosity, corruption, and a sense of freedom. Collectively, these
possibilities suggest that we should interpret the observed
relationships with some caution.</p>
<p>Another possible reason for a cautious interpretation of our results
is that some of the data come from the same respondents as the life
evaluations and are thus possibly determined by common factors. This is
less likely when comparing national averages because individual
differences in personality and individual life circumstances tend to
average out at the national level. To provide even more assurance that
our results are not significantly biased because we are using the same
respondents to report life evaluations, social support, freedom,
generosity, and corruption, we tested the robustness of our procedure by
splitting each country’s respondents randomly into two groups.24 We then
examined whether the average values of social support, freedom,
generosity, and the absence of corruption from one half of the sample
explained average life evaluations in the other half of the sample. The
coefficients on each of the four variables fell slightly, just as we
expected.25 But the changes were reassuringly small (ranging from 1% to
5%) and were not statistically significant.<sup>26</sup></p>
<p>Overall, the model explains average life evaluation levels quite well
within regions, among regions, and for the world as a whole.27 On
average, the countries of Latin America still have mean life evaluations
that are significantly higher than predicted by the model (by about 0.5
on the 0–10 scale). This difference has been attributed to a variety of
factors including some unique features of family and social life in
Latin American countries.28 In partial contrast, countries in East Asia
have average life evaluations below predictions, although only slightly
and insignificantly so in our latest results.29 This may reflect, at
least in part, cultural differences in the way people think about and
report on the quality of their lives.30 It is</p>
<p><em>The relative frequency of the other benevolent acts depends on
local social and religious norms, as well as the role of private
benevolence as a substitute or supplement for institutional social
safety nets.</em></p>
<p>reassuring that our findings about the relative importance of the six
factors are generally unaffected by whether or not we make explicit
allowance for these regional differences.31</p>
<h2 id="benevolence-ranking"><strong>Benevolence ranking</strong></h2>
<p>In Table 2.2, we report country rankings for six measures of
benevolence. The first three are national average frequencies of people
who report engaging once or more in three benevolent acts during the
past month – donating, volunteering, and helping a stranger. The
donation answers are used, after adjusting for differences in national
income, in our Table 2.1 equation in the previous section.32</p>
<p>The remaining three indicators are quite different from the first
three. Instead of reporting the respondent’s <em>own</em> benevolent
acts, they capture respondents’ forecasts of how <em>others</em> would
behave when facing an opportunity to show benevolence. Specifically, the
so-called “wallet questions” ask respondents to say how likely it is
that their lost wallet or other valuable object would be returned if
found by: (a) a neighbour, (b) a stranger, or (c) a police
officer.<sup>33</sup></p>
<p>The rankings differ among the benevolent acts, and especially between
benevolent acts and expected rates of wallet return. The Nordic
countries are at the top in the rankings for expected return of wallets,
as shown in Table 2.2, and are also much higher than other countries for
actual wallet return, an important benevolent act. The relative
frequency of the other benevolent acts depends on local social and
religious norms, as well as the role of private benevolence as a
substitute or supplement for institutional social safety nets. Among
countries with incomplete social safety nets, more people fall between
the cracks, thereby increasing the need for private benevolence to fill
the gap.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the case of Finland, which has universally
available and high-quality health, education, and social support
systems. Inequality of wellbeing is low in Finland and our data suggest
a correspondingly lower need for private charity. A preference for
universal over targeted social</p>

<p>assistance may also help to explain their relatively low rankings for
the three benevolent acts other than the return of lost wallet return.
In the Finnish case, the contrast between the two sets of rankings is
especially marked between the frequency of helping strangers and that of
actual and expected return of lost wallets. All international
wallet-dropping experiments have shown Finland and the other Nordic
countries to be among the best places to lose your wallet. Given that
the return of a lost wallet is a very powerful way of helping strangers,
the low ranking for helping strangers may reflect fewer strangers around
who need help. A lost wallet exposes an immediate need, and that call is
indeed answered readily in the Nordic countries.34</p>
<p>There are a few countries where the ranking for helping strangers is
very high, while the ranking</p>
<p>for donating to charity is very low. Jamaica, Liberia, and Sierra
Leone are in the top ranks for helping strangers but have donation
rankings that are 80 or more places lower. Nigeria and Kenya, also in
the top ten for helping strangers, provide a less extreme contrast, but
still rank much higher for helping strangers than for donating. All five
countries are near the bottom of the ranking for expected wallet return
by police. People generally want to help others and are likely to choose
the best means available.35 Where institutional structures are weak,
helping strangers in need probably represents a far more effective
channel than donations to charities. In these countries, charities are
fewer and less likely to have the credible and efficient structures that
characterise effective benevolence, as illustrated in our review of
published research below.</p>
<h4 id="comparing-actual-and-expected-benevolence"><strong>Comparing
actual and expected benevolence</strong></h4>
<p>The wallet questions are of special interest as they are open to
experimental testing in two ways. First, they can be used to see whether
international differences in expected wallet return (by a stranger)
match international differences in the actual return of lost wallets.
They do. The first recorded international wallet drop experiment was by
Reader’s Digest and they repeated it recently in one city in each of 16
countries.36 Expected wallet return predicts actual return better in
1996 (r=0.71), than in 2018 (r=0.19), with some different cities
involved. A much larger experiment covering 40 countries, with over
17,000 wallets handed in at societal institutions rather than randomly
dropped,37 also shows a high correlation (r=0.62) with expected wallet
returns by strangers. These results show that cross-country differences
in the expected benevolence of others have the power to predict actual
benevolent behaviours by others.</p>
<p>The second valuable use of the wallet questions is to see whether
people are too optimistic or too pessimistic about the benevolence of
others. This was first done by comparing experimentally dropped wallets
in Toronto with large samples of answers from Toronto respondents to the
Canadian General Social Survey. The expected rate of return was 23% and
the actual return was over 80%.38 In the same vein, the 40-country study
showed actual return to be much higher than expected (1.8 times).
Finally, two-thirds of 200 wallets dropped in 20 North American cities
were returned, far higher than the author expected,39 and double that
expected by US respondents to the wallet stranger question in our 2019
data.40 Collectively, these data on expected and actual wallet return
show that people are far too pessimistic about the benevolence of
others.41 We show later that expected benevolence is a</p>
<p><em>These data on expected and actual wallet return show that people
are far too pessimistic about the benevolence of others.</em></p>
<p>substantial predictor of life satisfaction, meaning that people may
be made needlessly unhappy by their unwarranted pessimism.</p>
<p>The discussion above relates to wallets found by strangers since that
is the answer most open to testing by experiments. How might we expect
the three different wallet measures to relate to one another and to
other measures? The expected return by a neighbour is an indicator of
the local social context. Thus, individual answers to “having someone to
count on” are more highly correlated with the neighbour wallet answers
than with the other wallet answers. On the other hand, the police
answers are positively related to variables reflecting how highly people
rate their public institutions, especially the honesty and efficiency of
the judicial system. The answers for return by strangers are positively
correlated with the other wallet answers, and, as noted above, to the
actual return of dropped wallets. Across nations, actual wallet returns
were found to be highly correlated (r=0.65) with survey measures of
social trust.42</p>
<p>The police answers are most closely related to how people rate the
quality of their public institutions. These institutions are often
national in scope and differ greatly among countries. Thus, it might be
expected that international differences in police answers would explain
a larger share of the variations among individuals. This is indeed the
case, as the international share of the variance of the police answers
is much higher than for the other two.43</p>
<h2 id="benevolence-trends"><strong>Benevolence trends</strong></h2>
<p>In this section, we consider benevolence across the globe and over
time. We offer a brief summary of the relevant research before
presenting new data.</p>
<h4 id="a-review-of-previous-research"><strong>A review of previous
research</strong></h4>
<p>Recent evidence shows that empathy – imagining others’ perspectives
and feeling compassion for others – has fluctuated over time. For
instance, these two empathy types declined in American young adults from
1979–2009.44 Yet, after the global financial crisis, empathy increased
in both</p>
<p>American and Chinese youth, and benevolent values increased in
European youth.45</p>
<p>Other research has assessed actual helping behaviours (e.g., picking
up dropped papers) in 24 US cities over time. Mirroring the empathy
decline discussed above, between 1994 (53%) and 2005 (49%), Americans
were less likely to help strangers over time.46 Larger, denser, and
lower-income cities had lower rates of helping behaviours. Yet, this
trend was not observed consistently everywhere. A behavioural study
found a 10 percent decline in helping behaviour (mailing lost letters)
between 2001 and 2011 in the United States, but not in Canada.47 Yet,
long-term behavioural studies have found increased cooperation among
Americans between 1956 to 2017.48</p>
<p>As for self-reported benevolent behaviours, there were increases in
helping strangers between 2010/2011 and 2016/2017 globally, but not
giving time or money to charities.49 Yet, after this, <em>World
Happiness Report 2024</em> found increases in helping strangers,
volunteering, and donating, from 2017–2019 (pre-COVID) to 2020–2023
(during COVID).50 Here, we go beyond previous research by examining a
longer time frame.</p>
<p>There have been few studies examining crosscultural differences in
benevolent traits and acts, with sometimes differing results.51 For
example, one study examined cross-cultural variations in empathy across
63 countries, finding higher empathy scores in more collectivistic
countries.52 However, researchers examining self-reported benevolent
behaviours in 66 countries found higher rates of charitable giving in
more individualistic countries.53</p>
<p>The 40-country wallet-dropping study discussed above found that
wallets were returned 40% of the time when they had no money, and over
half (51%) the time when they contained money.54 That return rates were
higher for the wallets including money provides a likely example of the
‘clear positive impact’ effect we describe below. Returns were more
likely in countries with more universalist values (which are related to
individualism). These results are supported by another study with 21
countries, which found that people were less likely to help strangers in
cultures with more collectivist values.55</p>
<p>Taken together, empathy is higher in collectivist contexts, but
helping strangers (both self-reported and actual) appears to be lower in
these contexts. This apparent discrepancy may, at least in part, stem
from who respondents have in mind as a target when answering questions
about empathy as well as how people compare themselves to their peers.56
In particular, it is possible that empathy measures capture feelings
toward people you know well, which is very different from more
impersonal forms of helping (like helping strangers and returning lost
wallets). Indeed, new research suggests that providing assistance to
family and strangers predicts wellbeing through feelings of autonomy
while supporting friends increases feelings of closeness.57</p>
<h4 id="how-is-global-benevolence-changing"><strong>How is global
benevolence changing?</strong></h4>
<p>In Figure 2.2, we show the global trends in three types of benevolent
acts: donating, volunteering, and helping strangers. We also include a
variable called ‘prosocial’, which is equal to 1 for any respondent who
has done any of the three benevolent acts during the past month. We have
noted the post-COVID increases in benevolent acts in each of our past
three reports, being struck by the longevity of the increases appearing
first in 2020. In the 2024 data, we see a significant decline in the
frequency of benevolent acts since 2023.58 However, the size and
persistence of the post-COVID increases in benevolent acts are such that
even in 2024, four years after the onset of COVID, all three benevolent
acts were still more than 10% above their pre-pandemic levels in
2017–2019.59</p>
<p><em>Even in 2024, four years after the onset of COVID, all three
benevolent acts were still more than 10% above their pre-pandemic levels
in 2017–2019.</em></p>
<p><img src="_page_34_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 2.3 illustrates benevolence trends for 10 global regions. In
almost all regions, helping strangers is the most common benevolent act,
while volunteering is generally the least common.</p>
<p>There are notable regional differences in the modes of benevolence.
For instance, donations have been among the most common benevolent acts
in three regions: Southeast Asia; Western Europe; and North America,
Australia, and New Zealand (NANZ) – although in recent years, helping
strangers has become the most prevalent. In contrast, donations are the
least common form of benevolence in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America
and the Caribbean, where helping strangers is the primary benevolent
action. Volunteering was more commonly practised in</p>
<p>the Commonwealth of Independent States until 2014, at which point
donations became more frequent.</p>
<p>Regional differences may represent cultural variations that shape
norms for caring for others.60 In regions such as Central and Eastern
Europe, Latin America and Caribbean, and Middle East and North Africa,
an informal benevolent act, such as helping strangers, appears to be
more common than other formal acts of benevolence such as donating and
volunteering. On the contrary, regions including Southeast Asia, Western
Europe, and NANZ tend to engage more in formal helping behaviours,
particularly through sharing material resources. This may also be
influenced by institutions and policies in each</p>
<p><img src="_page_35_Figure_3.jpeg" /></p>
<p>country that encourage donations by monetary rewards, such as tax
credits.61</p>
<p>We also noticed regional differences in benevolence trajectories. The
post-COVID increase in benevolent acts was more prominent in regions
such as NANZ and Western Europe, and less pronounced in regions like
Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and Southeast
Asia. Meanwhile, some regions, such as Central and Eastern Europe and
Latin America and the Caribbean, showed an immediate surge in
benevolence after COVID-19, but this increase declined soon after. We
observe an overall decline in benevolence between 2023 and 2024 across
most regions, except for Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan
Africa, where levels remained stable. Nevertheless, the post-COVID
increase in benevolent acts (relative to the 2017–2019 average) remains
almost universally intact. NANZ is the only region where the prosocial
variable was not significantly higher62 in 2024 than in the pre-COVID
years (2017–2019), but even in that region, the helping of strangers is
still significantly higher than before the pandemic.</p>
<h2 id="benevolence-and-happiness"><strong>Benevolence and
happiness</strong></h2>
<p>In this section, we review the burgeoning research literature
suggesting that the wellbeing benefits of benevolent acts depend
fundamentally on their motivations, the ways in which they are designed
and delivered, and the extent of cooperation and collaboration among
givers and receivers. In short, we find that benevolent actions deliver
greater wellbeing benefits when they involve three Cs: caring
connections, choice, and a clear positive impact.63</p>
<h4 id="caring-connections"><strong>Caring connections</strong></h4>
<p>Much research supports this chapter’s finding that generous
behaviours are associated with — and often directly cause — increased
wellbeing among givers across the world.64 Even children as young as two
years old feel pleasure from giving to others.65 Previous research
examines various types of benevolent acts or ways in which people may
help one another that include and go beyond the Gallup World Poll
questions examined in this</p>
<p>chapter. These range from the more formal or institutional giving in
nonprofit organisations (e.g., donating money, volunteering time) and
workplaces (e.g., helping coworkers) to more informal everyday forms of
giving like helping friends, neighbours, family, and strangers.</p>
<p>Yet, there is evidence to suggest that the wellbeing benefits of
benevolent acts are often stronger for both helpers and beneficiaries in
<em>caring communities</em>. Thus, benevolent actions may deliver
greater wellbeing benefits to the extent to which they involve more
social connectedness and caring motivations.</p>
<p>There is some accuracy to the saying, “<em>charity begins at
home</em>”. Most often, people care for and share their resources with
others they regularly see, whether family,66 friends, coworkers, or
acquaintances. Giving behaviours often occur within social contexts and
simply witnessing someone else giving has positive effects on
wellbeing.67 Such behaviours can also spread through people’s social
networks,68 thus creating and reinforcing caring communities.</p>
<p>When social or relational aspects of giving are stronger, this can
amplify wellbeing among givers. Several social and relational factors
demonstrate this. For example, having <em>direct social engagement</em>
can amplify givers’ wellbeing. When volunteers engage directly with
others, they experience higher wellbeing compared to when they have more
indirect roles.69 In addition, <em>being closer to the recipient</em>
can also amplify wellbeing effects. For example, research finds that
spending money on stronger social ties increases happiness more than
spending on weaker social ties.70 When directly compared, giving to
loved ones increases reward centre activation in the brain more than
donating to charity.71</p>
<p>Recipients also benefit more from closeness. Although receiving gifts
can sometimes lead to feelings of indebtedness, receiving gifts can also
lead to happiness, especially when gifts come from stronger (as opposed
to weaker) social ties.72 Even when not directly interacting with
people, loved ones can inspire us to give and help. For example, simply
<em>being socially motivated</em></p>
<p><img src="_page_37_Picture_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>to give can amplify benefits to givers, as demonstrated by research
finding that those who volunteer for social reasons – because it’s
important to their loved ones – have higher self-esteem, wellbeing,
self-efficacy, and connectedness,73 and a lower risk of mortality among
older adults.74</p>
<p>In caring communities, the lines between “giver” and “recipient” blur
as everyone regularly occupies both roles through interactions over
time.75 Research on adolescents76 and older adults77 has found that
social support interactions that are more balanced – with similar levels
of giving and receiving – are associated with higher wellbeing, fewer
depressive symptoms, and even a lower risk of dying. However, other
research suggests that low levels of both giving and receiving, even if
balanced, are associated with</p>
<p>lower wellbeing.78 Thus, increased wellbeing is more likely when
people are embedded in mutual and frequent caring interactions.</p>
<p>Although giving within caring communities can support increased
meaning and joy, people often give beyond their own immediate groups, to
strangers both near and far, and, as reviewed below, this still feels
good. We review key psychological pathways that can extend one’s circle
of compassion more broadly beyond the people we know and love, creating
a sense of caring community across our cities, countries, and even
globally, to people we might not ever directly interact with.</p>
<p>One such pathway is <em>caring personality traits</em>, like
compassion or altruism. People with caring personality traits tend to
prioritise others’ needs and wellbeing, and they are often kind to
themselves as well.79 Notably, they also tend to have more balanced
social support interactions in their relationships,80 which has
implications for their wellbeing, as discussed above. But their care
extends beyond people they directly interact with, often giving to and
helping strangers in need.81 Much research supports the idea that more
compassionate people have higher wellbeing and experience fewer mental
health symptoms.82 Even in high-stress jobs, those who are more
compassionate report lower stress and burnout.83 These wellbeing effects
run deep, translating into lower stress hormones during stressful
situations84 and even a lower risk of dying among older adults.85</p>
<p>A related pathway that can extend one’s circle of compassion is
experiencing <em>caring emotions</em>, which increase altruistic
motivations, making people more likely to help others.86 For example, to
the extent that people experience increased feelings of benevolence
after giving to distant others (compared to close others), these
feelings increase their happiness.87 Thus, both compassionate traits and
feelings can feel rewarding to people, even when directed toward
strangers.</p>
<p>Another such pathway is <em>caring motivations</em>. People who have
such other-focused motivations experience more positive emotions and
higher self-esteem.88 When following such people over time, researchers
find that having caring motivations at one time point predicts later
increased positive emotions and self-esteem, fewer anxiety and
depression symptoms, and decreased feelings of loneliness, isolation,
and other negative feelings.89</p>
<p>People can have caring motivations in general, but such motivations
are often applied to specific prosocial behaviours. Although prosocial
behaviours may appear to be other-focused, there are many reasons that
people engage in them, such as self-enhancement, indicating that they
can be motivated by self- and/or otheroriented concerns.90 Research
consistently finds that not all acts of kindness offer equivalent
wellbeing benefits and that self-focused motives may undermine the
emotional rewards that typically follow other-focused prosocial
behaviour. For example, among volunteer healthcare workers,
other-oriented motives for helping predict higher life satisfaction, but
self-oriented motives do not.91 Other research confirms and extends
this, finding that volunteers with altruistic motivations have higher
self-esteem, wellbeing, self-efficacy, and connectedness,92 and
volunteers who value others report decreased distress.93 Even simply
recalling an instance of other-focused helping can increase positive
emotions compared to recalling an instance of self-focused
helping.94</p>
<p>Such other-oriented motivations also benefit nonprofit organisations,
in that volunteers with altruistic motivations also have increased
satisfaction with their volunteer role and more intentions to continue
volunteering in the future.95 Remarkably, other-oriented older adult
volunteers have a lower risk of dying when tracked over time compared to
those with more self-focused motivations.96</p>
<p>Research on blood donations displays a similar pattern on physical
pain measures. In one recent study, people reported less intense pain
from a vein puncture when blood was drawn for the purpose of
post-earthquake medical use than when blood was drawn for personal
medical tests.97 Taken together, research on caring traits, feelings,
and motivations suggest that the reason that people give is as important
as the actual giving behaviours in terms of promoting wellbeing.</p>
<p>Overall, giving in communities of care is more likely to lead to
emotional rewards than giving in disconnected or less caring contexts.
These communities can consist of people we interact with in our daily
lives,98 and can also imaginatively extend beyond known others, through
caring traits, feelings, and motivations. Next, we discuss two other
features that may be prevalent in such caring communities: freely
choosing one’s benevolent behaviours, and caring about the impact of
them.</p>
<h2 id="choice"><strong>Choice</strong></h2>
<p>Caring communities provide people with a variety of ways to help one
another as well as the choice of how to do so. For example, a teenager
living in a caring community can choose to volunteer at</p>
<p>the local homeless shelter, mentor younger children in a sport they
love, or assist an elderly neighbour with grocery shopping.</p>
<p>The opportunity to choose how to help others is important because
people are more likely to feel happy after giving when they have a sense
of autonomy or personal choice in how they help.99 Evidence supporting
this claim comes from studies exploring different kinds of prosocial
behaviour and research methods. For instance, in the realm of
volunteering, people can choose to help others for reasons that they
find personally valuable (autonomous motivations) or reasons that are
forced upon them (controlled motivations), and the reasons for
volunteering matter. A large survey conducted with over 700 college
students in China who volunteered during COVID found that volunteers who
endorsed more autonomous motivations for their actions experienced
greater satisfaction, meaning, and happiness.100 Meanwhile, volunteers
who expressed higher levels of controlled motivations reported lower
satisfaction, meaning, and happiness. Similar findings have been
observed using a large data set from the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent and Adult Health in the United States. Youth volunteers who
provide assistance voluntarily also reported lower levels of depression,
while volunteers who say their volunteering is “required by others” do
not.101</p>
<p>Similar findings have been observed when people give or transfer
money. For instance, in one study, 80 students were provided with a few
dollars to distribute between themselves and another person. Afterwards,
each student reported their wellbeing. Importantly, half of the students
were allowed to choose how much money, if any, they wanted to give to
the other person (high-choice). Meanwhile, the other half of students
were not given a choice in how the money was distributed, they were
simply told to distribute the money between themselves and the other
person (low-choice). Participants reported experiencing higher levels of
happiness when they gave more money to the other person, but only when
the participant had a choice over how much was given.102 Harbaugh and
colleagues (2007) arrived at a similar conclusion when looking at brain
activation as people donated to a local charity</p>
<p>while in an fMRI scanner. People showed activation in parts of the
brain that are commonly associated with pleasurable tasks or enjoyable
activities while giving, and this pattern of activity was greatest when
people made voluntary donations.</p>
<p>The importance of feeling as if one has exercised choice when helping
others can even be detected upon reflection. In one experiment,
individuals were asked to write about a time they chose to help another
person and a time in which they helped another person but had little
choice. After writing each description, participants reported their
current happiness. Consistent with the evidence reviewed above, people
reported greater momentary wellbeing after recalling a time they chose
to help someone else as opposed to a time they did not have a choice
about how to help.103</p>
<p>While not all situations allow people total freedom when deciding how
to engage in prosocial action, past research suggests it can be helpful
to provide even a small degree of choice. For instance, when people are
required to complete a prosocial act, such as contribute to their
child’s school or religious community, it could be helpful to allow
people to decide when (which date and time) and how (volunteer at a
fundraiser, donate from home) they would like to help. This flexibility
may protect one’s sense of choice and, in turn, bolster the joy of
giving. If this possibility is not viable, some research suggests that
reminding people they have some freedom to choose whether or not to help
can be beneficial. For example, in one study, 104 students were
instructed to help on a task.104 Half the students were told it was
“entirely their choice whether to help or not” while the other half of
students were told that they “should help out.” Afterwards, students
reported their wellbeing. Students who were reminded of their choice to
help reported greater happiness.</p>
<p>There are a few potential reasons why voluntary (as opposed to
involuntary) giving may lead to greater happiness. One possibility is
that freely chosen giving may fulfil a basic human urge to act in a way
that one chooses. Whether it be deciding what to eat for dinner or how
to assist others, having the freedom to make your own choices is a
strong predictor of happiness.105</p>
<p>Another reason that voluntary giving may lead to greater happiness is
that it allows people to show and act upon their personal preferences
when it comes to giving. If someone has a particular affinity for the
environment or caring for children, autonomous helping provides a chance
to help in this way. Finally, unforced giving may be especially likely
to bolster happiness because it provides people with evidence that they
are a kind and generous person, revealing their caring traits. Unforced
giving is particularly powerful proof because one’s kind act was
self-chosen and not required by external pressures, such as government
legislation or educational requirements.</p>
<h4 id="clear-positive-impact"><strong>Clear positive
impact</strong></h4>
<p>Caring communities may also encourage generosity by providing clearer
opportunities to see how one’s actions have made a positive impact on
others. Indeed, caring communities may be more likely to foster a clear
dialogue or exchange of information that allows recipients to relay what
they need, and for helpers to appreciate how their assistance has been
effective.</p>
<p>Classic research in psychology has shown that recognising how one’s
actions are effective is a key predictor of whether one helps. For
instance, research on what is called “the identifiable victim effect”
has documented that people are more likely to help one clear
identifiable target in need over a larger number of unknown targets.106
While there are various reasons for why people respond in this manner,
one contributing factor is that people can more clearly see or imagine
how their assistance will be effective when helping a singular, detailed
target over a larger number.107</p>
<p>Beyond encouraging people to act, recognising how one’s actions
positively impact others amplifies the joy of giving. For instance, in
one experiment, 120 students were given 10 Canadian dollars and were
then invited to donate some, none, or all to a charity before reporting
their happiness.108 Critically, half of the students were asked to
donate to a charity that made the positive impact of their work
incredibly clear by stating that every $10 purchases a bed net for a
child in need to stop the spread of malaria.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the other half of students were asked to donate to another
charity that also helped children in the same region but did not clearly
explain how the donation would be used. When the impact of the donation
was clear, people who donated more money to charity reported higher
happiness. Yet, when the impact of giving was not clear, people who gave
more money did not report greater happiness. These findings suggest that
creating or fostering opportunities for people to appreciate how they
have helped others can increase the wellbeing of the helper.</p>
<p>Indeed, similar findings have been observed among living kidney
donors who tend to report the greatest positive reactions about their
actions when they feel like their donation was impactful in helping the
recipient survive.109 Thus, creating an opportunity for recipients to
meet the donor and express their appreciation may heighten feelings of
impact and the joy of giving. This may be why many nonprofits go to
great lengths to facilitate these connections and why some
organisations, like blood donor clinics, now allow donors to receive
messages when their contributions have been directed to a recipient.
Finally, feelings of efficacy may help to explain why activism behaviour
is not associated with wellbeing while other forms of helping often
are.110 The positive effects of one’s activism may be harder to see
given the nature of many ongoing social problems.</p>
<h4 id="our-new-evidence"><strong>Our new evidence</strong></h4>
<p>How are individual benevolent actions and perceptions of social
benevolence linked to life evaluations? To answer this question, we use
data from the 2019 Gallup World Poll which includes individual data for
the wallet questions discussed earlier.111 This allows us to see how
personally engaging in prosocial behaviour – versus believing that
others will act in a benevolent way – is linked to wellbeing.</p>
<p>Figure 2.4 shows that people’s prosocial actions and their beliefs
about the benevolence of others are both important predictors of
individual life evaluations when assessed within the same
equation.112</p>
<p><img src="_page_41_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>The ‘benevolent acts’ variable is the average frequency for the three
benevolent acts, with a value of 1 for individuals who performed each of
the three acts in the previous month. If the acts are included as
separate variables, each of them has a significant effect, about twice
as large for donations as for volunteering or helping strangers.113</p>
<p>Expected wallet return also has a large positive effect, almost twice
that for benevolent acts. Believing that others would return a wallet
predicts a larger boost to life satisfaction than a doubling of income.
Believing that your lost wallet would very likely be returned is
accompanied by life satisfaction that is higher by more than
three-quarters of a point on the 0–10 scale.114 This effect is almost
twice as large as being unemployed. It is also higher than the negative
effects of comparably measured expected harms from mental health issues
or violent crime.115</p>
<h2 id="benevolence-and-inequality"><strong>Benevolence and
inequality</strong></h2>
<p>The distribution of wellbeing among individuals and population groups
is as important as its average. In several recent editions of the World
Happiness Report, we have documented sharp increases in the inequality
of wellbeing globally116 and in most global regions117 as well as
growing gaps between the top and bottom halves of the population.118</p>
<p>Our latest analysis, shown in Figure 2.5, separates the trends in
wellbeing inequality within countries and between countries. The purple
line shows that the average within-country inequality of wellbeing has
increased by about one-quarter over the past two decades.119 As shown by
the pink line, the between-country inequality of wellbeing has remained
essentially unchanged at 0.2.120 The international share of total
individual variance in life evaluations, as shown by the blue line,121
has thus dropped, from 0.236 to 0.187.</p>
<p>Past reports have shown that wellbeing inequality itself lowers
national average happiness, while</p>
<p><img src="_page_42_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p><em>World Happiness Report 2020</em> broke new ground in showing that
living in countries with high social and institutional trust is of
significantly greater value for those afflicted by ill health,
unemployment, unsafe streets, and difficult family circumstances. These
afflictions are all more common among those reporting lower life
satisfaction. Thus, countries with higher trust have less inequality of
wellbeing, as revealed by using interaction terms between life
circumstances and measures of trust.122</p>
<p>Furthermore, caring and sharing reduce wellbeing inequality by being
more valuable to those facing less fortunate life circumstances. Data
from the</p>
<p>European Social Survey (2002–2022) show that people who judge most
people to be both fair and kind suffer materially less from being
subject to unemployment, ill health, discrimination, or unsafe
streets.123 The results are shown in Figure 2.6. These are large
effects, so the scale is different than in Figure 2.4.</p>
<p><em>Caring and sharing reduce wellbeing inequality by being more
valuable to those facing less fortunate life circumstances.</em></p>
<p><img src="_page_43_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>These interactions come from an equation using European Social Survey
data from 2002–2023 that also includes a large main effect, four-fifths
of a point on the 0–10 scale (as shown in Figure 2.7) for anyone living
in a country where they judge others to be both fair and helpful. Figure
2.7 also shows substantial positive effects from frequent social
meetings,124 high social trust,125 and trust in the police.126 The scale
in Figure 2.7 is the same as in Figure 2.6.</p>
<h2 id="benevolence-between-countries"><strong>Benevolence between

<p>Official Development Assistance (ODA) refers to government-provided
aid aimed at fostering economic development and improving the welfare of
low- and middle-income countries. It can be considered a form of
prosocial behaviour when viewed from the perspective of international
relations and collective welfare. However, ODA is also associated with
motivations such as strategic interests, political alliances, or
economic benefits. This duality of altruistic versus self-interested
motives makes ODA a nuanced example of prosocial behaviour.</p>
<p>To better capture the prosocial component, we focus on untied ODA
i.e., aid that is freely and fully available to finance procurement from
all countries. It differs from tied or partially tied aid which
restricts the procurement of goods or services to the donor country or a
specific group of countries. Tied aid can negatively affect aid
effectiveness by increasing the costs of goods and services, and
possibly deflecting policy priorities. Moreover, untied aid represents
the majority of total ODA commitment by many donors, thus we focus on
untied ODA in our analysis.127</p>
<p><img src="_page_44_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Another potential form of international prosocial behaviour is
hosting refugees, as it reflects actions taken by countries to assist
vulnerable populations in need, often at considerable cost and with
little or no immediate benefit to the host country. The number of
forcibly displaced people worldwide has risen significantly in recent
years. According to UNHCR’s 2024 Mid-Year Trends report, 122.6 million
people worldwide were forcibly displaced in the first half of 2024 due
to persecution, violence, conflict, human rights abuses, or events
disrupting public order. Of these, 32 million are refugees under UNHCR’s
mandate. While hosting refugees often aligns with prosocial and
altruistic values, it does not always stem purely from voluntary
goodwill. Geopolitical pressures, international legal obligations,
geographical location, and domestic political considerations frequently
play substantial roles. For instance, low- and middle-income countries
host 71% of the world’s refugees and other people in need of protection,
and 69% of refugees and others in need of international</p>
<p>protection reside in neighbouring countries. These figures illustrate
that hosting refugees is not always a purely prosocial activity. Given
that current data do not distinguish between voluntarily and
involuntarily hosted refugees, interpreting the estimated relationship
between the refugee ratio and happiness requires caution.</p>
<p>While numerous empirical studies at the individual level demonstrate
that prosocial spending enhances the giver’s happiness, research on how
prosocial behaviours by nations affect donor happiness remains scarce.
Most individual-level studies focus on the psychological mechanisms
behind giving, such as the warm glow effect or a sense of altruistic
satisfaction, which contribute to increased subjective wellbeing.
However, at the national level, prosocial behaviours like ODA and
refugee hosting involve complex dynamics that extend beyond individual
motivations. These behaviours are influenced by political, economic, and
social factors which can shape the perceptions and experiences of
citizens in donor countries. This section addresses this gap by
analysing the relationship between national-level prosocial actions and
donor happiness on a global scale. By examining data on ODA and refugee
hosting alongside measures of national wellbeing, this analysis explores
whether collective generosity translates into increased happiness for
donor populations.</p>
<p>We present the data for ODA and refugees first and then proceed to
empirical analysis. Table 2.3 shows the top 20 countries ranked by
untied ODA commitments as a share of GDP in 2022. It</p>
<p>refers to untied bilateral commitments that consist of grants and
grant-like contributions as well as loans in current dollars.128 We
calculate the untied ODA as a share of PPP-adjusted GDP and per capita
value ($US). The GDP and population data are retrieved from the World
Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI). The table reveals that
Western and Northern European countries generally exhibit higher per
capita values among the donor countries. In 2022, the top five countries
are Norway, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany, and Denmark.</p>

<p>Table 2.4 presents the top 20 countries ranked by the ratio of
resident refugees to population in 2022. The total numbers of refugees
in each country are also reported. Refugee statistics are sourced from
UNHCR, while population data is retrieved from the World Bank’s WDI to
calculate refugees as a percentage of the population. The table shows
that population refugee shares are highest in countries in the Middle
East, Africa, and Europe. Specifically, Lebanon, Jordan, Montenegro,
Türkiye, and Czechia were the countries with the highest refugee ratios
in 2022.</p>
<p>To assess the possible links to happiness, we added ‘ODA as % of GDP’
and ‘refugees as % of the population’ to our Table 2.1 equations for
life evaluations and emotions, as reported in the online ODA appendix.

<p>positive emotions. Neither ODA nor refugee shares show significant
links to negative emotions. The life evaluation links for ODA and
refugee shares are similar in magnitude after allowing for the different
cross-country variability of ODA and refugee shares. An increase in ODA
by one standard deviation is associated with a life evaluation higher by
.07 points, while an increase of the same relative size in the refugee
share is associated with an average life evaluation that is lower by .06
points. The data in Table 2.4 show</p>
<p>that refugee shares are highest in countries that share borders with
countries in turmoil or on escape routes from those countries. The
plausible positive effects of offering a safe haven for refugees are
being swamped by the pressures that fleeing populations place on
neighbouring countries that are often themselves short of the basics of
life.</p>
<p>The results in this section echo the general pattern of results
surveyed earlier in the chapter: benevolent acts are more likely to
support higher levels of happiness if they embody caring connections,
choice, and a clear positive impact. These features are less typical for
refugee flows, which are frequently driven by circumstances rather than
caring connections or choice, and impose costs on both refugees and
hosts. ODA is more likely to involve all of the three C’s. Since these
are national decisions, however, they may reflect national interests not
fully shared by the individuals whose happiness is being assessed.
Furthermore, both the decisions to donate and the possible benefits in
the receiving countries are far removed from the daily lives of
individuals in the donor countries, whose immediate surroundings and
social connections are likely to be of much greater importance. As for
future trends in ODA, it is apparently being cut entirely in the United
States, while being cut back in a number of other donor
countries.129</p>
<p>National decisions are likely to have more impacts on the wellbeing
of individuals in other countries to the extent that the resulting
actions create or destroy peace. Overall rankings of individual life
evaluations are especially low</p>
<p>in countries wracked by violence, notably Afghanistan and Lebanon,
and other countries not even in the rankings, such as Sudan and Syria,
because conditions have been too unsafe to permit surveys.</p>
<p>International caring and sharing are likely to be of most benefit to
global life evaluations, especially in conflict-ridden countries, to the
extent that they can create peace and heal the wounds of past conflicts.
Forgiveness is associated with higher life satisfaction in many
studies,130 especially where supported by favourable attitudes and
beliefs about others.131 These supporting attitudes are hardest to
establish in international settings and where there are long-standing
animosities and grievances. This makes it especially challenging to
achieve forgiveness and reconciliation in conflict and post-conflict
settings.132 Our findings in this chapter expose the need for the kind
of caring and sharing that delivers peace, forgiveness and
reconciliation. Building a broader international network of caring
connections seems to us a first necessary step, using such efforts to
supplant the force of arms.</p>

<li><p>2 Donations are the only one of the three benevolent acts to have
a statistically significant relation to average life evaluations at the
national level. In our results using individuallevel data later in the
chapter we find significant positive linkages for all three benevolent
acts. In our Table 2.1 results the donation variable removes the
influence of log GDP, leaving the coefficient on income to include those
effects that flow through their support for larger donations.</p></li>
<li><p>3 A country’s average answer to the Cantril Ladder question is
exactly equivalent to a notion of average underlying satisfaction with
life under an assumption of ‘cardinality’: the idea that the difference
between a 4 and a 3 should count the same as the difference between a 3
and a 2, and be comparable across individuals. Some social scientists
argue that too little is known about how people choose their answer to
the Cantril Ladder question to make this assumption and that if it is
wrong enough, then rankings based on average survey responses could
differ from rankings based on underlying satisfaction with life (Bond
&amp; Lang, 2019). Other researchers have concluded that answers to the
Cantril Ladder question are indeed approximately cardinal (Bloem &amp;
Oswald, 2022; Ferrer-i-Carbonell &amp; Frijters, 2004; Kaiser &amp;
Oswald, 2022; Krueger &amp; Schkade, 2008).</p></li>
<li><p>4 For any pair of countries, the confidence intervals for the
<em>means</em> (depicted in Figure 2.1 as whiskers) can be used to gauge
which country’s mean is higher than the other, accounting for
statistical uncertainty in the measurement of each. The confidence
interval for a country’s <em>rank</em> (given in Figure 2.1 as text, in
the form (4-8) represents a range of possible values for the ranking of
their mean among all countries, accounting for uncertainty in the
measurement of all of the means (following Mogstad et al. 2024). The
ranges are constructed so that the chance that the range does not
contain the country’s true rank is no more than 5%.</p></li>
<li><p>5 Not every country has a survey every year. The total sample
sizes are reported in the online Statistical Appendix and are reflected
in Figure 2.1 by the size of the 95% confidence intervals for the mean,
indicated by horizontal lines. The confidence intervals are naturally
tighter for countries with larger samples.</p></li>
<li><p>6 See Helliwell et al. (2020) for a detailed analysis of the life
satisfaction of immigrants to the United Kingdom and Canada from many
source countries.</p></li>
<li><p>7 In 2013 there was no significant difference between the male
and female responses while in this report (with surveys from 2022 and
2023) the male life evaluations are one-third higher than for females
(1.57/1.16). This is the largest gender gap ever seen in our reports,
where at the global level there is a slight advantage favouring
females.</p></li>

<li><p>10 All with drops of 0.17 or more on the 0–10 scale.</p></li>
<li><p>11 The online statistical appendix contains alternative forms
without year effects (Table A9) and a repeat version of the Table 2.1
equation showing the estimated year effects (Table A8). These results
continue to confirm that inclusion of year effects makes no significant
difference to any of the coefficients. In these aggregate equations,
adding country fixed effects (as in Table A10) lowers the coefficients
on relatively slowly moving variables where most of the variance is
across countries rather than over time, such as healthy life expectancy.
Our equations based on individual observations (e.g., Figure 2.4), where
income and health are measured by individual-level variables, include
both year and country fixed effects, with coefficients very similar to
those estimated without fixed effects.</p></li>
<li><p>12 The definitions of the variables are shown in Box 2.2, with
additional detail in the online statistical appendix.</p></li>
<li><p>13 The model’s predictive power is little changed if the year
fixed effects in the model are removed, with adjusted R-squared falling
only from 0.761 to 0.756.</p></li>
<li><p>14 The data and rankings for the 2022–2024 averages for the six
variables are to be found in Figures 48–65 of the online statistical
appendix. The rankings for positive affect are in Figures 66–68, and for
negative affect in Figures 69–71. The underlying annual data used in
estimating the equations shown in Table 2.1 are currently not available
on our website. We can at this time provide the data to researchers
approved by Gallup.</p></li>
<li><p>15 For example, unemployment responses at the individual level
are available in most waves of the Gallup World Poll. While they show an
effect size similar to that found in other research, the coefficient has
never been significant in the country-level equation and their inclusion
does not influence the size of the other coefficients.</p></li>
<li><p>16 The main differences are a larger income effect, presumably
flowing from the cyclical variations, and the insignificance of the
healthy life expectancy effect, probably due to its trend-like variation
in most countries.</p></li>
<li><p>17 Below, we use the term ‘effect’ when describing the
coefficients in these regressions; some caveats to this interpretation
are discussed later in this section.</p></li>
<li><p>18 In the equation for negative affect, healthy life expectancy
takes a significant positive coefficient, despite its positive simple
correlation with life evaluations in this aggregate dataset. This may be
due to the fact that in the global sample there is a positive
correlation between age and the frequency of reports of negative
emotions. Countries with higher healthy life expectancies have
respondents who are older on average, since the sample data are weighted
to replicate the actual age shares of the population.</p></li>
<li><p>19 This influence may be direct, as many have found, e.g., De
Neve et al. (2013). It may also embody the idea, as made explicit in
Fredrickson’s broaden-and-build theory (Fredrickson, 2001), that good
moods help to induce the sorts of positive connections that eventually
provide the basis for better life evaluations.</p></li>
<li><p>20 See, for example, the well-known study of the longevity of
nuns, Danner et al. (2001).</p></li>
<li><p>21 See Cohen et al. (2003) and Doyle et al. (2006).</p></li>
<li><p>22 The meta-analysis by Chida and Steptoe (2008) shows
significant linkages from positive affect to health, independent of the
effects of negative affect. For a recent survey of the links running
from positive emotions and life evaluations to subsequent morbidity and
mortality, see Pressman et al. (2019).</p></li>
<li><p>23 The prevalence of these feedbacks was documented in Chapter 4
of <em>World Happiness Report 2013</em>, De Neve et al. (2013).</p></li>
<li><p>24 For more detail, see Table 10 of the online Statistical
Appendix for <em>World Happiness Report 2018</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>25 We expected the coefficients on these variables (but not on
the variables based on non-survey sources) to be reduced to the extent
that idiosyncratic differences among respondents tend to produce a
positive correlation between the four survey-based factors and the life
evaluations given by the same respondents. This line of possible
influence is cut when the life evaluations are coming from an entirely
different set of respondents than are the four social variables. The
fact that the coefficients are reduced, but only very slightly, suggests
that the common-source link is real but very limited in its
impact.</p></li>
<li><p>26 The coefficients on GDP per capita and healthy life expectancy
were affected even less than were the coefficients on the survey
variables, and in the opposite direction in the case of the income
measure, being increased rather than reduced, once again just as
expected. The changes were very small because the data come from other
sources and are unaffected by our experiment. However, the income
coefficient does increase slightly since income is positively correlated
with the other four variables being tested, so that income is now able
to pick up a fraction of the drop in influence from the other four
variables. We also performed an alternative robustness test using the
previous year’s values for the four survey-based variables. Because each
year’s respondents are from a different random sampling of the national
populations, using the previous year’s average data also avoids using
the same respondent’s answers on both sides of the equation. This
alternative test produced similarly reassuring results as shown in Table
13 of the online Statistical Appendix in <em>World Happiness Report
2018</em>. The Table 13 results are very similar to the split-sample
results shown in Tables 11 and 12, and all three tables give effect
sizes very similar to those in Table 2.1 in the main text. Because the
samples change only slightly from year to year, there was no need to
repeat these tests with this year’s sample.</p></li>
<li><p>27 Actual and predicted national and regional average 2022–2024
life evaluations are plotted in Figure 72 of the online statistical
appendix. The 45-degree line in each part of the figure shows a
situation where the actual and predicted values are equal. A
predominance of country dots below the 45-degree line shows a region
where actual values are below those predicted by the model, and vice
versa. Southeast Asia provides the largest current example of the former
case, and Latin America of the latter.</p></li>
<li><p>28 See Rojas (2018) and Chapter 4 of this report.</p></li>
<li><p>29 If special variables for Latin America and Southeast Asia are
added to the equation in column 1 of Table 2.1, the Latin American
coefficient is +0.49 (t=5.3) while that for Southeast Asia is -0.3
(t=2.1). Special variables for East Asia and South Asia are not
significant.</p></li>

is estimated to be slightly larger (0.87 rather than 0.73), although not
significantly so, if we include a separate regional variable for Latin
America. This is because perceived corruption is worse than average in
Latin America and its happiness effects there are offset by stronger
close-knit social networks, as described in Rojas (2018). The inclusion
of a special Latin American variable thereby permits the corruption
coefficient to take a higher value.</p></li>
<li><p>32 The donation variable on its own adds more to the explanatory
power of the Table 2.1 equation than does an average of the three
variables. In a later section of this chapter we use individual-level
data to show that each of the three benevolent acts is associated with
reported life evaluations, with the donation effect significantly larger
than the others.</p></li>
<li><p>33 The data are drawn from the Lloyd’s Register Foundation World
Risk Poll, included as part of the 2019 round of the Gallup World Poll.
The answers were on a three-point scale anchored by ‘not at all likely’
at 0 and very likely at 1. The middle option, ‘somewhat likely’ was
coded as 0.5. The same question form and scale were also used to assess
negative rather than positive risks, including the risks from violent
crime and from mental health problems. This made it possible to compare
the subjective wellbeing effects of positive and negative risks
evaluated in comparable terms, as will be reported later in the
chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>34 If we compare the data from countries in the 40-country study
(Cohn et al., 2014) we find <em>actual</em> wallet return in the three
Nordic countries in the study (Sweden, Denmark and Norway) to be 81%,
compared to 47% in the other countries in their global sample. The
<em>expected</em> wallet return by strangers (as ranked in Table 2.2) is
also much more likely in the Nordic countries, at 47%, than in the other
countries, at 28%. Hence, perceptions match reality in that wallet
return is higher in the Nordic countries than in other places. Yet, in
the Nordic countries and elsewhere, people underestimate the kindness of
others, as will be shown later in this chapter. These results are all
shown graphically in the first of the online wallet figures.</p></li>

volunteering.</p></li>

return to the imaginary owner.</p></li>
<li><p>38 See Helliwell and Wang (2011) for the fullest description, and
also Helliwell and Aknin (2018) and Helliwell et al. (2019).</p></li>
<li><p>39 Rober (2019). He also did sub-experiments to show that the
unexpectedly high wallet return rate applied equally to rich and poor,
and equally to males and females.</p></li>
<li><p>40 Of the 20 cities, 18 were in the United States and 2 in
Canada. The expected rate of return for wallets found by strangers is
34% in the US and 39% in Canada.</p></li>
<li><p>41 These results are also shown in the second of the online
wallet figures.</p></li>
<li><p>42 Knack (2001). His analysis was based on the first Reader’s
Digest wallet drops, in the late 1990s.</p></li>

full set of country fixed effects. These are .206 for police, .125 for
neighbours, and .080 for strangers.</p></li>

<li><p>47 See Hampton (2016) in which the result is based on modelling
that controls for differences in average neighbourhood characteristics.
It shows a 10% drop in the United States, but no significant change in
Canada. In 2001 there was no variation in altruistic behavior based on
neighborhood diversity. However, areas of the United States where the
proportion of non-citizens increased since 2001 experienced reduced
helping; the opposite was found in Canada.</p></li>

<li><p>58 These declines in the average frequency appear significantly
(as indicated by non-overlapping 95% confidence regions) for each of the
three benevolent acts as well as the prosocial umbrella variable.
Donation frequency was down from 34.6% in 2023 to 31.7% in 2024, while
helping strangers fell from 61.4% to 58.8%, and volunteering from 24.2%
to 22.9%. The prosocial frequency fell from 73.1% to 70.0%.</p></li>
<li><p>59 For prosocial, 70% in 2022–2024 vs 63% 2017–2019. For
donations, 31.7% vs 28%. For helping strangers 58.8% vs 50%, and for
volunteering 22.9% vs 20%. These differences in means are all highly
significant, p&lt;.001.</p></li>
<li><p>60 Joshanloo and Bond (2023) use Gallup World Poll data from 2019
to investigate the extent to which religiosity, trust, income and
individualism, which vary among countries and cultures, serve to
moderate the links between volunteering and life satisfaction. When all
moderations considered together, only trust and religiosity appear, both
with negative moderating effects (their Model 5).</p></li>

<li><p>111 The data for the likelihood of wallet return as well as
comparably measured negative risks posed by violent crime and poor
mental health, are drawn from the Lloyd’s Register Foundation World Risk
Poll for 2019.</p></li>
<li><p>112 The estimated equation for the Cantril Ladder includes
country fixed effects for which the coefficients are not shown. Control
variables included in the equation but not shown in the figure are
gender, age and age squared, married or living as a couple, separated
divorced or widowed, having a health problem, and having a college
education. The sample includes 123,050 observations from the 2019 Gallup
World Poll supplemented by additional questions asked for the Lloyd’s
Register Foundation World Risk Poll.</p></li>
<li><p>113 The coefficients are .246 for donations, .100 for helping
strangers and .089 for volunteering.</p></li>
<li><p>114 To guard against the possibility that this effect would be
inflated by the use of individual data for expected wallet return, we
have used the data for actual return of wallets in the 40 country sample
of Cohn et al. (2019), and find that it adds significantly to the
explanation of life evaluations in those countries. The estimated
coefficient on the Cohn et al. (2019) return rate for wallets with money
is 1.87 (t=4.4).</p></li>
<li><p>115 Standardised betas provide another way of comparing the
explanatory power of the key variables in the equation. The standardised
betas are +0.078 for expected wallet return (t=20.5), +0.048 (t=12.2)
for performing all three benevolent acts in the previous month, -0.024
(t=6.5) for believing harm from violent crime very likely, -0.035
(t=9.3) for believing mental health problems very likely, and -0.040
(t=11.5) for being currently unemployed. The wallet return effect
explains almost as large a share of total variance as the log of
household income at 0.108 (t=23.7) or the five-point scale for
self-assessed health, -0.097 (t=26.8).</p></li>
<li><p>116 The lower right panel of Figure 2.2 of <em>World Happiness
Report 2022</em> shows that global inequality of wellbeing, not
population-weighted, but treating each country with equal weight,
increased by about 20% from 2007 to 2019.</p></li>
<li><p>117 Figure 2.5 of <em>World Happiness Report 2022</em> shows
inequality converging between the two parts of Europe and generally
rising in all other regions.</p></li>
<li><p>118 This is shown in Figures 2.3 and 2.4 of <em>World Happiness
Report 2023</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>119 As measured by the within-country coefficient of variation
(COV), within-country inequality has grown from .35 to .44 from
2005–2010 to 2020–2024.</p></li>
<li><p>120 As measured by the coefficient of variation (COV) of country
level average life evaluations in each of the four time
periods.</p></li>
<li><p>121 As measured by the r2 of a regression of individual ladder
answers on a set of country dummies.</p></li>
<li><p>122 See Chapter 7 of this report for a discussion of how trust
and life satisfaction predict voting behaviour.</p></li>
<li><p>123 Wu and Nugent (2024) do a parallel analysis using Gallup
World Poll data, with broadly similar results to those shown here for
ESS data.</p></li>
<li><p>124 Represented using a seven part Likert scale where 0 is none
and 1 is every day.</p></li>
<li><p>125 These are the answers, converted to a 0 to 1 scale, to a
question about how much others can be trusted, with a zero to 10 scale
ranging from not at all to completely.</p></li>
<li><p>126 This variable is like that for general social trust, but in
this case referring to trust in police.</p></li>
<li><p>127 As noted in the online ODA appendix, the two series are
highly correlated (0.971) so that the regression results are very
similar using the alternative definitions.</p></li>

<h2 id="key-insights-1"><strong>Key Insights</strong></h2>
<p><strong>For over a decade,</strong> the <em>World Happiness
Report</em> has shown that social connections are important drivers of
happiness, both at the individual and national level, and across
cultures.</p>
<p><strong>In this chapter,</strong> we present new evidence on an
understudied measure of social connection – sharing meals. Given the
relatively objective way in which it is measured, sharing meals is
uniquely comparable across countries and cultures, between individuals,
and over time.</p>
<p><strong>Using novel data for 142 countries and territories</strong>
collected by Gallup in 2022 and 2023, we find stark differences in rates
of meal sharing around the world. While residents of some countries
share almost all of their meals with other people, residents of other
countries eat almost all of their meals alone. These differences are not
fully explained by differences in income, education, or employment.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing meals</strong> proves to be an exceptionally strong
indicator of subjective wellbeing – on par with income and unemployment.
Those who share more meals with others report significantly higher
levels of life satisfaction and positive affect, and lower levels of
negative affect. This is true across ages, genders, countries, cultures,
and regions.</p>
<p><strong>In the United States,</strong> using data from the American
Time Use Survey, we find clear evidence that Americans are spending more
and more time dining alone. In 2023, roughly 1 in 4 Americans reported
eating all of their meals alone the previous day – an increase of 53%
since 2003. Dining alone has become more prevalent for every age group,
but especially for young people.</p>
<p><strong>Meal sharing</strong> also appears to be closely related to
some, but not all, measures of social connectedness. Most notably,
countries where people share more meals have higher levels of social
support and positive reciprocity, and lower levels of loneliness.</p>
<p><strong>Nevertheless,</strong> there remain vast gaps in our
understanding of the causal dynamics of meal sharing, subjective
wellbeing, and social connections. We point to a number of promising
avenues for future research and discuss implications for policy.</p>
<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Social connections are critically important for human health,
happiness, and prosperity. People who are more socially connected tend
to be happier, less stressed, more satisfied with their lives, less
prone to depression, more engaged in their communities, and less likely
to suffer from disease or disability.1 In their professional lives,
people with more social connections are more creative, cooperative,
trusting, and likely to be promoted.2 They are less likely to commit
crimes, earn higher levels of income, and live longer lives.3</p>
<p>At the same time, social isolation and loneliness are strongly
associated with negative life outcomes. The absence of social ties has
been linked to higher rates of disease, shorter life expectancies, lower
levels of subjective wellbeing, higher rates of criminality, and greater
support for authoritarianism.4 One widely cited meta-analysis estimated
that the negative health consequences of loneliness and isolation were
roughly equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day.5 In short, to
paraphrase Dr. Chris Peterson, one of the founding fathers of positive
psychology – other people matter.</p>
<p>Social connections are not only important for individual health and
happiness, but also for societal health and happiness writ large. People
who are more connected to each other are more trusting of others and
have more faith in institutions.6 They are more likely to donate to
charity, be more politically engaged, and report higher levels of pride
in their communities.7 They tend to be more considerate and
compassionate, not only towards friends and family, but also towards
strangers. They are more likely to volunteer time to help those in need
and share resources with others.8</p>
<p>In this chapter, we explore links between sharing meals, social
connections, and wellbeing. Although the topic of sharing meals has
remained relatively understudied in the academic literature, the
connection between food and social relationships is far from new. In
French, <em>copain</em> (friend) and in Italian <em>compagno</em> (mate)
come from the Latin <em>cum+pa–nis</em>, literally “with-bread”. The
Chinese</p>
<p>term for companion/partner, 伙伴, stems from a similar term (火伴)
which literally translates to “fire mate”, a reference to sharing meals
over a campfire.</p>
<p>Recently, an emerging body of empirical evidence has begun to point
to potential links between sharing meals and a range of social benefits.
One review of the literature found that adolescents who ate more meals
with family members had better diet and nutritional habits, lower levels
of obesity, fewer eating disorders, and greater academic achievement.9
Another experiment found strong links between meal sharing and positive
affect, although these effects were diminished with increased smartphone
use during meal times.10 Yet another study of roughly 9,000 older adults
in China found that sharing meals with others was associated with lower
rates of depression.11</p>
<p>In this chapter, we extend this body of work by looking at the
relationship between sharing meals and wellbeing using novel data
collected on a global scale. We present evidence from the first-ever
global dataset on social eating, collected in 2022 as part of the
Ajinomoto module on the Gallup World Poll. In 2023, Gallup asked these
questions again in 17 countries. More than 150,000 people from around
the world answered the following two questions: “Thinking about the last
7 days … (i) On how many days did you eat lunch with someone you know?
(ii) On how many days did you eat dinner with someone you know?” In
addition to this new dataset, we present new evidence from the American
Time Use Survey (ATUS) in the United States on the association between
sharing meals, social connections, and wellbeing over time.</p>
<p>Our aim is twofold. First, we explore the extent to which sharing
meals can serve as an indicator of social connectedness. In this
respect, the number of meals shared with others has a number of
advantages compared to existing proxies. The act of sharing a meal is
relatively objective and straightforward to report. Even if it is
self-reported (as are all survey questions), the number of shared meals
is an observable and objective aspect of people’s lives. Conversely,
many other measures of social connectedness rely on more subjective
assessments. For example, survey</p>
<p>respondents may be asked to report how close they feel to friends and
family, how many close relationships they have in general, or how often
they feel isolated or left out.</p>
<p>While undeniably valuable, these sorts of questions present a series
of challenges for researchers studying the relationship between
subjective measures of wellbeing and subjective indicators of social
connection. For one, statistical correlations between all subjective
measures tend to be artificially high to begin with. This can make it
seem like subjectively reported variables are more closely related to
each other than they really are. Moreover, it is often difficult to
assess whether one person’s self-report of a close social connection is
directly comparable to someone else’s. These problems are exacerbated
when trying to make comparisons across countries and cultures, or over
long periods of time.</p>
<p>A metric based on the number of shared meals is poised to address
these issues. Sharing meals is a cross-cultural social ritual, practiced
every day by millions of people. It is a universal practice. This is
particularly useful when studying social connections and wellbeing on a
global scale as it allows for relatively reliable international and
intercultural comparisons. The number of meals shared with others is
also much more objectively comparable over time than related measures of
social engagement. While interpretations of closeness or belonging may
evolve and change over time, the number of meals shared with others is
not expected to. In this way, our approach is operationally similar to
other well-established questions to measure related aspects of human
capital. For example, the question “How many books were there in your
home when you were 16?” is routinely used by international surveys to
measure parental cultural capital.12</p>
<p>Our second aim in this chapter is to consider the relationship
between sharing meals and subjective wellbeing. Given the strong link
between wellbeing and social connections, sharing meals with others may
be an important indicator of positive wellbeing. This indeed turns out
to be the case. We present the largest and most robust evidence to date
showing that sharing meals with others is strongly predictive of greater
life evaluations, increased</p>
<p><em>We present the largest and most robust evidence to date showing
that sharing meals with others is strongly predictive of greater life
evaluations, increased positive affect, and decreased negative
affect.</em></p>
<p>positive affect, and decreased negative affect. We also find that
dining alone is at least as (if not even more) strongly associated with
low levels of wellbeing.</p>
<p>However, studying the correlation between sharing meals and wellbeing
raises an important issue of causality. Does sharing meals make people
happier? Or do people who are happy to begin with share more meals? Or,
perhaps even more likely, is the relationship bi-directional? These are
important questions with significant implications for research and
policy. We do not conclusively resolve them here. While we discuss
preliminary evidence and efforts to get at the underlying causal
dynamics of meal sharing and subjective wellbeing, arriving at a full
answer to this question is a task that remains open to future
research.</p>
<p>To begin, we present new global evidence on the variation in meal
sharing and dining alone around the world. We then turn to the
relationship between sharing meals and subjective wellbeing.
Specifically, we consider the extent to which sharing meals with others
is associated with life evaluations, positive affect, and negative
affect. Next, we generate novel indicators of meal sharing and dining
alone using data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) to take a
closer look at links between sharing meals and subjective wellbeing over
time in the United States. Finally, we consider associations between
meal sharing and a range of related social indicators. We conclude with
a discussion of policy implications and point to a number of promising
avenues for future research.</p>
<h2 id="sharing-meals-around-the-world"><strong>Sharing meals around the
world</strong></h2>
<p>In 2022 and 2023, the Gallup World Poll asked representative samples
in 142 countries and territories how often they ate lunch or dinner with
family, friends, or anyone else they knew.13 In Figure 3.1, we present
regional differences in meal sharing, broken down by lunches and
dinners. Additional regional descriptive statistics are provided in
Table A1 of the online appendix.</p>
<p>Overall, we find stark differences in the frequency of dining with
others and dining alone around the world. Latin America and the
Caribbean emerges as the global leader in meal sharing. On average,
residents of these countries share approximately 9 meals with other
people per week. At the bottom of the list is South Asia, where people
report eating fewer than 4 meals with others per week.</p>
<p>The relatively low levels of meal sharing in both South and East
Asian countries is particularly notable. Past research has found that
dining</p>
<p>alone is on the rise in East Asian countries, most notably in Japan
and the Republic of Korea.14 Two of the most commonly cited explanations
are the rise of single-person households and demographic ageing.
However, differences in the interpretation of the survey items used to
measure meal sharing may also play a role. There are some indications
that East and South Asian respondents may be less likely to consider
family members or other members of their household as “someone you
know.”15 Whatever the underlying explanation, the considerably low rates
of meal sharing in these regions clearly warrant further
investigation.</p>
<p>However, these regional differences also mask significant variation
across countries. In Figure 3.2, we present rates of meal sharing for
all countries. Full country rankings are provided in Table A2 of the
online appendix. Senegal tops the list, where residents report sharing
11.7 meals with others per week on average. Gambia, Malaysia, and
Paraguay come next, where residents report sharing approximately 11
meals with others per</p>
<p><img src="_page_63_Figure_7.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_64_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>week. Iceland is the only country from Europe or North America
represented in the top 10 with an average of 10 meals shared per week.
Canada ranks 53rd with 8.4 meals shared per week, the United States
ranks 69th, and the United Kingdom ranks 81st. Germany appears in 91st
place, while India ranks 132nd with 4 meals shared per week. At the very
bottom of the list are Bangladesh and Estonia, where residents report
sharing only 2.7 meals per week.</p>
<p>We present additional maps with lunches and dinners considered
separately in Figures A1 and A2 of the online appendix. Overall, the
dynamics are broadly consistent with Figure 3.2. Senegal and Gambia
continue to rank highly in both categories, Iceland jumps to second
place for shared dinners, and Middle Eastern countries including Iran
and Morocco move closer to the top for shared lunches. Residents in the
United States,</p>
<p>Canada, New Zealand, and Australia are much more likely to eat dinner
with others than they are to share lunches. On average, residents of
these countries share roughly 5 dinners per week – more than twice as
much as residents in the Republic of Korea, Japan, and Mongolia where
respondents report sharing just 1 to 2 dinners per week.</p>
<p>The underlying explanations for these differences are sure to be
complex and multifaceted. Nevertheless, explanations that appeal to
differences in income alone seem unlikely. For example, one potential
interpretation of our results could be that people who eat more meals
overall also share more meals with other people. If so, one might expect
that residents of high-income countries would eat more meals overall,
and therefore eat more meals with other people than residents of
low-income countries.</p>
<p>However, the fact that low-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and
Latin America report such high levels of meal sharing casts doubt on the
assumption that more meals eaten with others is simply a function of
more meals eaten overall. Although we do observe a moderate and
statistically significant correlation of 0.2 between income and meal
sharing at the country level, this association explains only 4.6% of the
global variation in meal sharing.16 Explaining the other 95.4%
represents a rich opportunity for future research.</p>
<p>In Figure 3.3, we extend our analysis by plotting the number of
shared meals for all regions broken down by age. In almost every region,
younger people share more meals with others. This is an important
difference worth further study. If meal sharing is a strong proxy for
(and potentially a causal contributor to) subjective wellbeing, then
age-related differences in meal sharing may shed new light on
differences and changes in wellbeing across the lifespan, and over
time.</p>
<p>Considering gender, men and women report similar numbers of meals
shared per week around the world. Across all regions, we find that
gender</p>
<p><img src="_page_65_Figure_4.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_66_Picture_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>differences in meal sharing are statistically insignificant. These
results are presented in Figure A3 in the online appendix.</p>
<h2 id="sharing-meals-and-wellbeing"><strong>Sharing meals and
wellbeing</strong></h2>
<p>In the previous section, we documented considerable differences in
meal sharing around the world. In this section, we consider what, if
anything, these variations can tell us about corresponding differences
in subjective wellbeing. Our focus throughout this section will be
specifically on life evaluations, positive affect, and negative affect.
Once again, we rely on survey responses from the Gallup World Poll in
2022 and 2023.</p>
<p>In Figure 3.4, we present the overall relationship between life
evaluations measured using the Cantril Ladder17 and the total number of
meals</p>
<p>shared with others in the previous week. We calculate country
averages for both variables so that each point on the graph represents a
different country.</p>
<p>Overall, we find a positive relationship between sharing meals and
life evaluations. Across countries, sharing one more meal per week is
associated with an average increase of roughly 0.2 points on a scale
from 0 to 10. This difference is both statistically significant and
practically meaningful. A difference of 0.2 points is roughly equivalent
to a difference of five places in the global happiness rankings
presented in Chapter 2 of this report.</p>
<p>However, to better understand the relationship between sharing meals
and subjective wellbeing, it is worth diving deeper into the data to
consider differences in meal sharing and subjective wellbeing across
individuals.</p>
<p><img src="_page_67_Figure_8.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 3.5 shows average life evaluations by the number of meals
shared per week based on individual comparisons rather than country or
regional averages. In general, we see an upward trend – albeit a subtle,
uneven one – in average life evaluations as the number of shared meals
increases. The largest difference in life evaluations is between those
who eat all meals alone and those who eat one meal with someone else.
People who shared just one meal in the past week have notably higher
life evaluations (5.2) than those who ate all meals alone (4.9). This
0.3-point difference is again statistically and practically significant.
For context, it is about half as large as the decline in life evaluation
associated with unemployment, which is consistently found to be one of
the largest effects documented in the wellbeing literature.18</p>
<p>From there, life evaluations tend to increase as the number of shared
meals increases.19 Life evaluations are broadly constant (5.2 to 5.3)
for people who shared 1–5 meals in the past week</p>
<p>and uptick slightly (5.5 to 5.6) for those who ate 5–8 meals with
others. People who shared 9–10 meals reported average life evaluations
of 5.7, which increases to 5.8 for those who shared 11 meals per week.
The peak occurs for those who shared 13 meals with others in the
previous week, reporting average life evaluations of 6.1.</p>
<p>In Figures 3.6 and 3.7, we plot relationships between meal sharing
and wellbeing by gender and age. Even at this fine-grained level of
analysis, we find strong and significant associations between sharing
meals and subjective wellbeing. Sharing meals not only predicts more
positive life evaluations, but also higher levels of positive affect and
lower levels of negative affect. The relationship between sharing meals
and positive affect is particularly strong – even stronger than the
relationship between sharing meals and life evaluations. Overall, we
estimate the correlation between positive affect and meal sharing to be
0.44. Correlations for life evaluations and negative affect are 0.34 and
-0.21, respectively.</p>
<p><img src="_page_68_Figure_5.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_69_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>When we consider men and women separately in Figure 3.6, we find no
statistically significant difference in the link between sharing meals
and life evaluation by gender, nor do we find strong evidence of gender
differences in the association between positive affect and meal sharing.
In other words, sharing meals appears to be just as important for men
and women in terms of how they evaluate their lives and how often they
experience positive emotions.</p>
<p>However, when we consider negative emotions, the story begins to
change. First, it is worth noting that men report considerably lower
levels of negative affect than women overall. This is consistent with
evidence presented in this and previous editions of the <em>World
Happiness Report</em>. Second, we also find that sharing meals appears
to be more closely related to negative emotions for women than for men.
Women who spend more time dining alone report much higher levels of
negative affect than women who spend more time dining with others. This
is also true for men, but the difference is smaller than it is for
women. This is indicated by the steeper slope of the line for women in
the third panel of Figure 3.6.</p>
<p>In Figure 3.7, we present the relationship between sharing meals and
wellbeing for younger (age 16–24) and older (age 65+) adults. Results
for all age groups are presented in Figure A4 of the online appendix.
There are two clear takeaways.</p>
<p>The first is the overall difference in subjective wellbeing across
the two age groups, represented by the gap between the purple (16–24)
and pink (65+) lines. Older adults report higher life evaluations than
young people overall, but lower levels of positive affect. In other
words, they are more likely to report being satisfied with their lives
as a whole but less likely to report feeling happy the previous day. We
observe no significant differences in levels of negative affect between
younger and older adults.</p>
<p>The second feature – perhaps more relevant for this chapter – is the
difference in the slope of the lines, where steeper lines represent
stronger relationships between meal sharing and subjective wellbeing.
Overall, we find the relationship between sharing meals and life
evaluations, as well as the relationship between sharing meals and
positive affect, to be stronger for younger people than for older
people. When we compare young people who dine alone to young people who
share meals, we find much greater differences in life evaluations and
positive affect than we do for older adults. We do not observe similar
patterns for negative affect – for both young and old, eating more meals
alone is equally predictive of higher levels of negative affect.</p>
<p>As a final note, not only do people who share more meals report more
positive emotions overall, they also seem to enjoy their food more. In
Figure 3.8, we plot average levels of reported</p>
<p><em>Put simply, across regions, countries, and cultures, for men and
women, young and old, sharing more meals is associated with greater
subjective wellbeing.</em></p>
<p>enjoyment while cooking and eating for those dining alone compared to
those dining with others. We find a clear positive trend in both cases.
The more meals we share with other people, the more we seem to enjoy
them.</p>
<p>Recent research has also suggested that individuals who feel more
positively about different aspects of their eating experience tend to
have higher life evaluations and experience more positive emotions.20
Taken together, this may suggest that dining experiences are an</p>
<p><img src="_page_70_Figure_6.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_71_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>important, if sometimes overlooked, ingredient in shaping overall
wellbeing.</p>
<p>To briefly summarise, in the previous section, we observed sizable
differences in rates of meal sharing around the world. This was true
across regions, countries, and individuals. While we did not find
significant differences in rates of meal sharing for men and women,
younger people appear to eat more of their meals with others in almost
every region of the world.</p>
<p>In this section, we found that differences in sharing meals are also
closely related to differences in subjective wellbeing. This is true
across multiple levels of analysis. At the country level, countries
where residents share more meals report greater average life
evaluations. At the individual level, men and women who eat more meals
with others report greater life evaluations, increased positive affect,
and decreased negative affect – although the relationship between meal
sharing and negative affect appears to be stronger for women than it is
for men. We observed similar dynamics across age cohorts. Both younger
and older adults who share more meals report higher levels of wellbeing,
but these links are stronger for the young than the old. Finally, we
noted that sharing meals is particularly important for positive affect,
more so than for life evaluations or negative affect. Put simply, across
regions, countries, and cultures, for men and women, young and old,
sharing more meals is associated with greater subjective wellbeing.</p>
<h2 id="testing-possible-explanations"><strong>Testing possible
explanations</strong></h2>
<p>A key question to emerge from these results is whether sharing meals
with others is merely an indicator of wellbeing, or a direct causal
contributor to it. While we cannot conclusively answer this</p>
<p>question here, we can begin to consider some potential
explanations.</p>
<p>For example, eating alone may simply be more affordable than eating
with others. This seems particularly likely in high-income countries,
where sharing meals with others may be more common in restaurants. If
so, perhaps the reason we find such a strong relationship between
happiness and sharing meals is simply because people who share more
meals have more money.</p>
<p>Or consider the related case of (un)employment. It is plausible to
imagine that employed adults who eat at work are more likely to share
meals than those who are unemployed. If so, then the link between
sharing meals and wellbeing may be partially, or even substantially,
reducible to differences in employment.</p>
<p>To address these concerns, Figure 3.9 presents the results of
multivariate linear regressions which estimate the relationships between
meal sharing, life evaluation, positive affect, and negative affect for
all regions while controlling for a variety of other potentially
relevant factors. Specifically, we control for gender, age, education,
employment, income, household size, and country fixed effects. We also
control for people’s ability to meet basic needs for food, as measured
by the question “Have there been times in the past 12 months where you
did not have enough money to buy the food that you or your family
needed?” With these controls included, if we continue to observe a
significant relationship between sharing meals and subjective wellbeing,
we can be more confident that this relationship is important in its own
right, and not merely attributable to other factors.</p>
<p>In fact, this is precisely what we observe. Even after accounting for
income, education, employment, and other key indicators, we continue to
find strong and robust relationships between sharing meals and
subjective wellbeing around the world. In almost all regions, sharing
more meals with others proves to be highly predictive of higher life
evaluations, more positive affect, and less negative affect.</p>
<p>However, there are notable differences in the magnitude of these
relationships across regions. The relationship between sharing meals
and</p>
<p>wellbeing appears to be particularly strong in North America,
Australia, and New Zealand. In these countries, the differences in
wellbeing between those who eat more or fewer meals alone is greater
than for any other region. One potential interpretation of this result
is that the importance of sharing meals with others may be driving the
relatively high levels of meal sharing we observe in this region (Figure
3.1). However, we do not observe similar dynamics for Latin America and
the Caribbean. While meal sharing is most common in this region, it does
not appear particularly important for wellbeing relative to other parts
of the world.</p>
<p>We find similarly complex relationships between levels of meal
sharing and its importance for wellbeing at the opposite end of the
spectrum. In East Asia – where meal sharing is relatively rare (Figure
3.1) – we find strong links between sharing meals and negative affect,
but weak links when it comes to life evaluation or positive affect. At
the same time, sharing meals with others appears to be particularly
important for life evaluations and negative affect in South Asia –
another region with relatively low levels of meal sharing overall – but
less so for positive affect. Here again, all of these effects are
estimated after controlling for age, gender, income, education, and
employment. Taken together, the relationship between how often meals are
shared and how important meal sharing is for wellbeing is clearly
neither simple nor straightforward. Examining and identifying</p>
<p><img src="_page_72_Picture_9.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_73_Figure_2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>potential explanations for these differences can provide a rich
opportunity for future research.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, although the magnitude of these relationships may
differ across regions, their direction does not. Even after controlling
for a wide variety of other factors, sharing meals continues to be
strongly and consistently associated with better life evaluations,
increased positive affect, and decreased negative affect around the
world.</p>
<h2 id="assessing-practical-significance"><strong>Assessing practical
significance</strong></h2>
<p>The fact that we observe such strong and consistent links between
sharing meals and wellbeing is striking. But how significant are these
relationships practically? Given the impressive size and scope of our
dataset, it is certainly possible to find statistically significant
relationships that are nonetheless relatively small, and therefore
perhaps not useful for real-world applications or matters of policy.</p>
<p>One way to assess the practical significance of meal sharing is to
consider how much this variable reveals about wellbeing compared to
other important social indicators. To that end, we briefly return to
income and employment. Decades of research has found strong and sizable
links between income, unemployment, and subjective wellbeing.18 In
particular, the dramatic decline in life evaluation associated with
unemployment is one of the largest and most consistent effects to emerge
from empirical wellbeing research. If we compare the significance of
these associations with sharing meals, how do they stack up?</p>
<p>In Figure 3.10, we present the results of a series of regression
analyses testing the extent to which income, unemployment, dining alone,
and sharing meals explain variation in subjective wellbeing around the
world. In each panel, we estimate four separate regressions in which we
relate differences in subjective wellbeing (considered as the dependent
variable) to differences in sharing meals, dining alone, income
quintile, and unemployment (considered as independent variables). In
Panel A, we consider relationships</p>
<p>with life evaluation, Panel B with positive affect, and Panel C with
negative affect. In each case, we measure the extent to which
differences in the independent variable of interest can explain
differences in the dependent variable of interest. This is estimated
empirically by the R-squared value produced by each regression. By
implication, the size of the bars in each figure represent the extent to
which differences in e.g., shared meals can explain differences in e.g.,
life evaluation.</p>
<p>In our view, the results of these analyses are the most striking so
far. Not only do we find sharing meals and dining alone to be important
predictors of wellbeing compared to income and employment, but in many
cases, they seem to be even more so. That is, asking people if they
shared at least one meal last week can tell us more about their overall
life evaluation than knowing if they are unemployed. Or relatedly,
knowing how many meals someone shared last week can tell us more about
their positive emotions than their income.21</p>
<p>Again, the links with positive affect are particularly notable. When
explaining variation in positive emotions, the extent to which people
share meals with others is a more important predictor than both income
and unemployment combined. At the same time, sharing meals also does a
better job explaining variation in life evaluations around the world
than income or unemployment. Dining alone is a more important predictor
of differences in life evaluations than unemployment, but not income.
For negative affect, income continues to be a crucially important
indicator, yet sharing meals and dining alone are not far behind.
Indeed, both prove to be more powerful predictors of negative emotions
than unemployment.</p>
<p><em>Not only do we find sharing meals and dining alone to be
important predictors of wellbeing compared to income and employment, but
in many cases, they seem to be even more so.</em></p>
<p><img src="_page_75_Figure_2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Taken together, these results underscore the importance and
usefulness of sharing meals as an indicator of subjective wellbeing. The
fact that we observe such strong links between sharing meals, life
evaluations, positive affect, and negative affect suggests that meal
sharing should be given much more weight and attention by researchers
and policymakers around the world.</p>
<p>However, our discussion in this section is not intended to resolve
the thorny matter of causation. While we find strong and significant
associations between sharing meals and wellbeing, this could indicate
that sharing meals itself causes people to be happy, or that happy
people are more likely to share meals with others. Even after
controlling for a range of related variables, we cannot conclusively
rule out either explanation. In all likelihood, both dynamics are
probably true, at least to some extent. The question of which pathway is
stronger is nevertheless important and we will return to it in the final
section. Before that, we turn to the United States to take a deeper look
at changes in meal sharing over time.</p>
<h2
id="meal-sharing-over-time-a-case-study-of-the-united-states"><strong>Meal
sharing over time: a case study of the United States</strong></h2>
<p>So far, our analysis has been based on data from the Gallup World
Poll, collected from over 150,000 survey respondents in more than 140
countries. The size and scope of this data allowed us, for the first
time, to compare differences in meal sharing and its relationship to
subjective wellbeing for more people and more countries than ever
before.</p>
<p>However, this survey module was only introduced in 2022, so we are
unable to examine how meal sharing has changed over time. Given the
close association between sharing meals and subjective wellbeing, this
is an important perspective to consider as it may provide an objective
yardstick for thinking about longitudinal changes in subjective
wellbeing.</p>
<p>To this end, this section turns to data collected by the American
Time Use Survey (ATUS) in the United States from 2003 to 2023. Each
year, the ATUS asks a representative sample of roughly</p>
<p><img src="_page_76_Picture_7.jpeg" /></p>
<p>12,000 Americans how they spend their time on a day-to-day basis.
Survey respondents fill out long and detailed questionnaires about what
they did the day before, who they did it with, and how they felt while
doing it.22 This data has been used and referenced extensively in
research, media, and policy circles. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, the
extent to which Americans spend time eating and cooking alone or with
others has remained relatively unexplored.</p>
<p>Longitudinal trends in meal sharing are particularly important when
considered against the backdrop of declining social capital and
connection in the United States. These trends were starkly documented by
Robert Putnam in his landmark 2000 book, <em>Bowling Alone</em>. Drawing
on a truly expansive array of datasets, Putnam found that Americans were
spending more and more time alone, while civic institutions and social
organisations including religious groups, labour unions, veterans’
associations, and even dinner parties were declining. These declines
were occurring alongside similar declines in political participation,
voting rates, trust in other people, faith in institutions, indicators
of physical and mental health, rates of educational achievement, social
mobility, and economic opportunity.</p>
<p>More recent studies have reinforced this general story of social
decline in the United States and found evidence of similar trends in
other countries.23 One large-scale study looking at data from 1990 to
2012 in 30 European countries found that participation in social groups
was falling while distrust in political institutions was rising.24</p>
<h2 id="meal-sharing-over-time-in-the-united-states"><strong>Meal
sharing over time in the United States</strong></h2>
<p>With this context in mind, we begin our analysis by plotting the
number of people dining alone in the United States over time in Figure
3.11. Each dot represents the percentage of survey respondents who
reported eating all of their meals alone the previous day. Our sample
includes approximately 235,000 American adults from 2003 to 2023 and is
weighted to be representative of the general population. Importantly,
this measure of meals shared the previous day is also distinct from
prior sections in which we considered meal sharing over the course of an
entire week.</p>
<p>The trendline is unmistakable. There has been a sharp rise in the
number of Americans dining alone since 2003. Perhaps unsurprisingly,
some of the highest levels of dining alone were recorded</p>
<p>in 2019 and 2020 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. However,
rates of dining alone were increasing long before the pandemic, and they
have not come down since. In 2023, the most recent year for which data
is available, rates of dining alone in the United States were even
higher than they were during the pandemic. Roughly 1 in 4 American
adults (26%) now report eating all of their daily meals alone – an
overall increase of more than 50% since 2003.</p>
<p>In Figure A5 of the appendix, we present a series of robustness
checks which expand our definition of dining to include cooking and food
preparation, and consider the percentage of total meals eaten alone,
rather than a binary indicator of every meal eaten alone. In each case,
the results all point in the same direction. In one of the most
reliable, reputable, and widely used time-use datasets in</p>
<p><img src="_page_77_Figure_6.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_78_Picture_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>the world, we find clear and consistent evidence that, with every
passing year, Americans are spending more and more time dining
alone.</p>
<p>At this point, it is worth considering one obvious potential
explanation for these trends – the rise in living alone. It is
well-documented that Americans have become increasingly likely to live
by themselves.25 In Chapter 4 of this report, we see similar results for
European countries. There are many reasons for this. Some of the most
widely cited</p>
<p><em>In one of the most reliable, reputable, and widely used time-use
datasets in the world, we find clear and consistent evidence that, with
every passing year, Americans are spending more and more time dining
alone.</em></p>
<p>explanations are declines in family size, delays in marriage and
parenthood, and increased economic opportunity for women. These, and
related dynamics, have led to a considerable rise in the share of
one-person households in the United States – a trend that we confirm
using ATUS data in Figure A6 of the online appendix.</p>
<p>We conducted a series of analyses to see if the rise in living alone
can explain the rise in dining alone in the US. In Figure A7, we find
that people who live alone are considerably more likely to eat alone.
This was particularly true during the COVID-19 pandemic, yet has barely
come down in the years since. In 2023, roughly 70% of those living alone
reported eating all of their meals alone the previous day, compared to
20% of those who live with others.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to <em>changes</em> in dining alone, there has
been a greater relative increase in dining alone among those who live
with others (Figure A8). To be specific, in 2023, roughly 18% of
Americans who live with others ate all of their</p>
<p>meals alone the previous day, compared to 12% in 2003 – an increase
of 50%. Among people who live alone, the corresponding figures are 69%
in 2023 and 55% in 2003 – an increase of 25%.</p>
<p>So, does living alone explain dining alone? To some extent it does.
In regression analyses, we estimate that recent increases in living
alone explain 15–20% of associated increases in dining alone (Figure
A9).26 Nevertheless, even after controlling for household size, we
continue to find sizable and significant increases in dining alone since
2003. This remains true even after controlling for age, sex, gender, and
income. By implication, while we do find evidence that the rise in
living alone is, at least partly, to blame for the rise in dining alone,
there is clearly much more to the story.</p>
<p>In Figures 3.12 and 3.13, we present similar trends in dining alone
broken down by gender and age. We find that men have generally been more
likely to eat all of their meals alone on the previous day than women
since 2003. However, we observe sharp and similar increases in dining
alone for both genders. Today, both men and women are eating more meals
alone than ever before.</p>
<p>Results for different age groups are another story entirely (Figure
3.13). As we observed in Gallup’s global data, older people are much
more likely to spend time dining alone than younger people. In this
case, we present results for 10-year age cohorts from 18-year-olds to
over-65s. In every year since 2003, over-65s report eating more meals
alone than their younger counterparts. Rates of dining alone for those
under the age of</p>
<p><img src="_page_79_Figure_5.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_80_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>45 are among the lowest recorded and remained largely consistent and
comparable – that is, until 2018. Beginning in 2018, we observe sharp
increases in dining alone for almost every age group. The trendlines for
those under 35 are particularly stark.</p>
<p>In Figure 3.14, we normalise rates of dining alone for all age groups
to their 2003 levels and plot the overall changes for each cohort in the
years since. We see that levels of dining alone have increased for every
age group since 2003, even among older cohorts who were already much
more likely to dine alone 20 years ago. Nevertheless, the largest and
most dramatic changes are for those under 35. The extent to which 25- to
34-year-olds report eating all of their meals alone on the previous day
has increased by more than 180% in two decades. We observe a similarly
dramatic increase for 18- to 24-year-olds.</p>
<p>Such sizable increases in rates of dining alone among young adults in
the US clearly and urgently warrant further research and policy
attention. We are not the first to document concerning levels of</p>
<p><em>Such sizable increases in rates of dining alone among young
adults in the US clearly and urgently warrant further research and
policy attention.</em></p>
<p><img src="_page_81_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>isolation among young people,27 but many of the explanations
emanating from public discourse and academic literature are somewhat
unsatisfying in the present context.</p>
<p>Most notably, the rise of smartphones and social media is often
credited with observable declines in young people’s wellbeing. However,
when it comes to dining alone, the timelines do not line up as neatly as
one might expect. With the launch of Facebook in 2004 and the
introduction of the iPhone in 2007, you might expect that the sharpest
increases in dining alone would emerge around these times. Instead, we
observe a relatively steady and consistent rise in young people dining
alone from 2003 to 2015, followed by increasingly steeper inclines in
the years since.</p>
<p>Another common explanation for (or at least contributor to) the
decline in young people’s mental health has been the COVID-19 pandemic.
Indeed, we do see some of the highest recorded rates of dining alone
during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021. However, rates of dining alone
were increasing long before the pandemic began to spread in the United
States. During the pandemic, rates of dining alone among young people
even appear to have declined slightly – potentially reflecting more
meals eaten at home with family members. If the pandemic was the whole
story, we may also expect rates of dining alone among young adults to
have declined in more recent years. In fact, we observe the highest
levels of dining alone among those under 35 in 2023.</p>
<p>While we certainly do not reject the notion that COVID-19 may have
contributed to higher levels of isolation among young adults, the timing
suggests that it has not been the primary driver of increases in dining
alone.</p>
<h2
id="meal-sharing-and-subjective-wellbeing-in-the-united-states"><strong>Meal
sharing and subjective wellbeing in the United States</strong></h2>
<p>For the remainder of this section, we turn from the overall levels
and trends in meal sharing to the relationship between meal sharing and
subjective wellbeing. In 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2021, the American Time
Use Survey included a special wellbeing module in which all respondents
were asked about their daily emotions and their overall satisfaction
with life (using the Cantril Ladder). In Figure 3.15, we use this data
to compare average</p>
<p>differences in life evaluation between Americans who reported eating
all of their meals alone in the previous day relative to those who
shared meals.</p>
<p>We find that Americans who dine alone reported life evaluations that
are, on average, 0.5 points lower than those who dine with others. We
observe similarly large differences in life evaluations when we split
our sample by age cohorts and gender. Dining alone is strongly
associated with substantial differences in subjective wellbeing for both
men and women, young and old alike.</p>
<p>In Figure 3.16, we present analogous results for happiness,
tiredness, stress, pain, and sadness. Again, we split our sample by
Americans who reported eating all meals alone on the previous day
compared to those who ate at least one meal with someone else and plot
the average levels of daily emotions for each group.</p>
<p><img src="_page_82_Figure_7.jpeg" /></p>
<p>In line with prior results, we observe notable differences in
emotions between those who share meals and those who dine alone.
Differences in happiness, pain, and sadness are particularly large,
although we also find slight differences in selfreported levels of
stress. In each case, Americans who eat more meals with others report
higher levels of positive affect and lower levels of negative affect
than those who dine alone. We find no significant differences for
tiredness.<sup>28</sup></p>
<p>In Tables A3, A4, and A5 of the online appendix, we conduct a series
of robustness checks to estimate the size and strength of the
relationship between dining alone and subjective wellbeing using linear
regressions. In every instance, we find that differences in life
evaluations, positive affect, and negative affect between Americans who
dine alone and Americans who share meals are</p>
<p>statistically significant at a 99% confidence level. This is true
even when controlling for age, sex, geographic location, marital status,
and race. In an echo of earlier results, relationships with positive
affect are strongest. In Table A5, using standardised measures of all
wellbeing outcomes, we find that gaps in happiness, in particular, are
larger than those estimated for life evaluations or any other affect
measure under consideration.</p>
<p>Taken together, our results in this section point to concerning
declines in how often Americans share meals with each other. Unlike
other social indicators, such as loneliness or depression, the
relatively objective nature of sharing meals makes it a uniquely
reliable metric by which to compare differences over time. The fact that
fewer Americans report sharing meals with others is particularly
concerning given the close relationship</p>
<p><img src="_page_83_Figure_5.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_84_Picture_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>between meal sharing and subjective wellbeing – a relationship that
we have now confirmed in two separate large-scale representative
datasets. In the final section of this chapter, we take one last look at
the link between sharing meals and social connections, and what this
link may tell us about societal health and stability writ large.</p>
<h2 id="sharing-meals-and-social-connections"><strong>Sharing meals and
social connections</strong></h2>
<p>In this final section, we turn our gaze to the relationship between
sharing meals and social connections. One plausible interpretation of
the importance of sharing meals is that it promotes and sustains social
ties. Given the widely documented, well-established links between
positive social relationships and subjective wellbeing,29 this could
help to explain our results in previous sections.</p>
<p>Moreover, if sharing meals really does help to build and sustain
social ties, it is not only academically interesting but politically
important. As decades of social science research has demonstrated –</p>
<p>and this year’s <em>World Happiness Report</em> highlights – social
connections are not only important for individual health and happiness,
but for societal health and happiness writ large.30</p>
<p>With this backdrop in mind, we return to the country-level data
provided by the Gallup World Poll (GWP) and incorporate additional data
from the Global Preferences Survey (GPS) administered by Gallup in 2012.
The GPS captured detailed information regarding risk and time
preferences, positive and negative reciprocity, altruism, and trust from
a large sample of roughly 80,000 individuals in 76 countries,
representing more than 90% of the world’s population. It remains one of
the most reliable, robust, and expansive datasets on political and
economic opinions to date.31 Additional details and variable
descriptions for GPS and GWP data are provided in Table A7 of the online
appendix.</p>
<p>In Figure 3.17, we present country-level correlations between GPS
indicators of trust and reciprocity in 2012 with rates of meal sharing
collected by</p>
<p>Gallup in 2022 and 2023. These are presented numerically in Table A6
of the online appendix. Overall, we find positive relationships between
levels of meal sharing, trust, and reciprocity. We observe the strongest
relationships for indicators of positive reciprocity, social support,
and loneliness. Associations with measures of negative reciprocity,
trust, and altruism tend to be more modest.</p>
<p>In Figure 3.18, we plot analogous associations for dining alone. In
this case, relationships between dining alone and indicators of social
connectedness appear stronger. Dining alone is negatively correlated
with all measures of social capital under consideration, except for
loneliness, where we find a positive correlation. Links with trust,
social support, and reciprocity again seem to be the most robust. Many
of these relationships – calculated at the country level, rather
than</p>
<p><em>Why is sharing meals so strongly predictive of subjective
wellbeing but only moderately related to indicators of social trust,
reciprocity, and altruism?</em></p>
<p>respondent level – are also statistically significant. We find
significantly negative correlations between dining alone and various
measures of reciprocity, trust, and altruism.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is worth noting that relationships between sharing
meals and dining alone with many of the social indicators under
consideration are relatively weak and, in some cases, statistically
insignificant. This is surprising when evaluated in the context of the
results presented in previous</p>
<p><img src="_page_85_Figure_9.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_86_Figure_4.jpeg" /></p>
<p>sections of this chapter and raises an important question. Why is
sharing meals so strongly predictive of subjective wellbeing but only
moderately related to indicators of social trust, reciprocity, and
altruism?</p>
<p>One answer to this question is somewhat technical. Although our
analysis is based on data collected from individual survey respondents,
Figures 3.17 and 3.18 compare averages across countries. This is
unavoidable as several of the indicators under consideration were
measured using different surveys at different times. As the survey
respondents did not respond to every question, we’re unable to make
individual-level comparisons. However, this higher level of analysis
comes at a cost. Most notably, the number of observations is now much
smaller as we are considering countries rather than individuals. This
smaller sample size could help to explain</p>
<p>the large confidence intervals we observe in the figures above.</p>
<p>Many of these indicators are also measured using different time
scales. For example, sharing meals and loneliness are asked in terms of
the past week or previous day, but questions on trust and reciprocity
are asked in much broader terms e.g., time spent helping strangers or
volunteering in the past month. This too could help to explain why we
find relatively weak relationships between sharing meals and some
indicators of social connectedness.</p>
<p>Another potential explanation is that the positive benefits of
sharing meals may operate through channels that have little or less to
do with social connections than one might expect. We have already
commented on this dynamic with regard to income, education, and living
alone. While we found some supportive evidence of all three</p>
<p>channels – that is, people who share more meals are more likely to be
employed, more likely to earn higher levels of income, and more likely
to live with others – none could fully account for the differences in
rates of meal sharing we observe around the world, nor could they fully
explain the relationship between sharing meals and subjective
wellbeing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these may not be the only mechanisms at play. People
who share more meals with others may also be more likely to eat
healthily, be more physically active, spend more time outdoors, spend
less time behind screens, live in more densely populated areas, and so
forth. Any or all of these factors could help to explain why sharing
meals is so strongly related to subjective wellbeing without needing to
appeal to any role it may or may not play in promoting social
connections.</p>
<p>Yet another potential explanation is even more subtle. While social
connections, broadly construed, are generally taken to be a good thing
for individuals and societies writ large, recent research has begun to
add a few important asterisks to the story. Not all social attitudes and
behaviours are equally important for wellbeing, nor are they necessarily
related to each other.</p>
<p>It is entirely plausible to imagine that people who have others to
rely on in times of need may still lack trust in societal institutions.
People who feel strongly connected to their communities may,
nevertheless, spend little time volunteering or helping strangers in
need. Those who donate money to charity may still strongly believe that
people who treat others unfairly ought to be punished. Even more
importantly, not all of these social attitudes and behaviours are likely
to be equally important for subjective wellbeing.</p>
<p>To draw this point out, consider the case of social support and
loneliness. Fortunately, in the 2022 and 2023 waves of the Gallup World
Poll, many of the same survey respondents were asked how often they
shared meals with others, how often they felt lonely, and if they had
others to count on in times of need. In Figure 3.19, we group these
individuals into five categories depending on how often they share meals
and present average levels of loneliness and social support for each
group.</p>
<p>We find clear evidence that individuals who share more meals with
others are significantly less likely to feel lonely (Panel A) and
significantly more likely to experience social support (Panel B). Now
that we can analyse individual-level responses, as opposed to country
averages, our sample size is considerably larger and our resulting
estimates are much more precise. This analysis suggests that sharing
meals may indeed strengthen and support social ties. Even so, it may
still suggest little to nothing at all about levels of trust.</p>
<p>To return to our earlier question, the fact that we find such strong
relationships between sharing meals and wellbeing, while simultaneously
finding modest or even mixed links between sharing meals and trust or
reciprocity, may simply suggest that meal sharing is more conducive or
supportive of certain types of social attitudes and behaviours than
others. This interpretation could explain why sharing meals is so
closely related to social support and loneliness – both of which have
consistently been shown to be strong predictors of subjective wellbeing
in their own right. Nevertheless, there is clearly much more to be
explored in future research regarding the correlational and causal
relationships between sharing meals, dining alone, and social
connections.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>In this chapter, we have presented new evidence on the global
variation in meal sharing and what it implies for subjective wellbeing
and social connections. Unlike most indicators of social relationships,
and all indicators of subjective wellbeing, the number of meals shared
with others is relatively objective and directly comparable across
individuals, between countries, and over time. This feature makes
sharing meals (and its counterpart, dining alone) uniquely valuable and
well-positioned to reveal new insights into the nature and dynamics of
human wellbeing.</p>
<p>Overall, we find stark differences in meal sharing around the world.
These differences prove to be closely tied to age – on average, younger
people share more meals with others than older adults – but mostly
unrelated to gender. Global</p>
<p><img src="_page_88_Figure_2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>differences in meal sharing are also not fully explained by regional
or individual characteristics such as income, employment, or household
size.</p>
<p>When we examine the link between sharing meals and subjective
wellbeing, we find that individuals who share more meals with others
report higher levels of life satisfaction, lower levels of negative
affect, and especially higher levels of positive affect.</p>
<p>In the United States, rates of meal sharing appear to be in stark
decline, while rates of dining alone are on the rise. This is true for
both genders and all ages, but particularly for young adults. Finally,
we find rates of meal sharing to be closely tied with a handful of
related social indicators – most notably, social support and loneliness
– while being only modestly related to others including reciprocity and
trust.</p>
<p>However, our analysis also has some limitations. First, and most
importantly, we are unable to answer the key question of causation.
There is already considerable evidence that social connections
contribute to greater wellbeing,32 and early suggestive evidence that
sharing meals with others may promote social connection.33 However, more
research is clearly warranted. Second, in our analysis of Gallup World
Poll data, we are unable to properly control for the fact that some
respondents might skip either lunch or dinner. This element might be
particularly relevant in countries where many citizens are exposed to
food insecurity. Third, although our analyses converge in highlighting
the association between meal sharing and wellbeing, they do not delve
deeply into the mechanisms driving this relationship. Factors such as
the quality of social interactions, the type of meal, or other
confounding variables (e.g., work schedules and working from home) may
play a significant role but are not explored.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the strong and robust relationships
between sharing meals, wellbeing, and social connections that we have
documented in this chapter cry out for future research and exploration.
One of the most fruitful avenues for future research relates to the key
question of causation. At present, it remains unclear whether sharing
meals leads to greater wellbeing or whether greater wellbeing leads to
more shared</p>
<p>meals. In all likelihood, both are probably true, at least to some
extent. Large-scale experiments such as the Health and Happiness Study,
which will administer daily surveys and collect real-time smartphone and
smartwatch data from a global sample population, may help shed new light
on the underlying causal dynamics of sharing meals, social connection,
and wellbeing.34 Small-scale experiments conducted in more controlled
environments may also help to pin down the causal nature of these
relationships and would represent a meaningful and important
contribution to research.</p>
<p>As a final point, it is worth commenting on the possible policy
implications of these findings. While researchers and policymakers have
long lamented declines in social connectedness across modern societies,
isolating the key contributing factors and identifying solutions has
proven frustratingly difficult. If sharing meals is just as important
for promoting social ties and subjective wellbeing as the evidence in
this chapter suggests, it may serve as a uniquely valuable, actionable,
and cost-effective policy tool by which to facilitate and promote
societal welfare. Several initiatives including Project Gather in the
United States have already begun to chart exciting new pathways along
these lines by providing financial support for shared meals.35 As
Dr. Vivek Murthy, the sponsor of the program and former US Surgeon
General eloquently put it, “When we gather with others around food, we
not only feed our bodies but also nourish our spirits.”</p>

days, on how many days did you eat LUNCH/DINNER with someone you know;
including family, friends, or anyone else you know.” In 2022, the

<li><p>15 Following the revised wording in 2023 (see Footnote 13), in
two countries – Japan and Cambodia – the average number of meals shared
rose by a substantial and statistically significant margin. However,
even in this case, Japan’s rate of meal sharing remained well below
average. At the same time, in other countries including Malaysia, the

which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at

et al. (2018), and Chapter 6 of the 2017 edition of the <em>World
Happiness Report</em> (De Neve and Ward, 2017).</p></li>
<li><p>19 It is perhaps also worth noting that we observe slight
declines in life evaluations and increases in negative affect for those
who eat 14 meals with others per week. One potential explanation for
this result is that individuals who report sharing all of their weekly
meals with others may be uniquely different from other groups. They may,
for example, be more likely to live with children or in group settings.
They could also be younger or more prone to financial difficulties than
those with more flexibility in the number of meals they share with
others. Alternatively, this may also be due to measurement error or
rounding issues as it represents the upper bound of the scale. We cannot
conclusively distinguish between these explanations. A full
investigation of this dynamic remains open to future research.</p></li>
<li><p>20 This research comes from the Ando Foundation/Nissin Food
Products Satisfaction With Food Enjoyment and Variety Survey. See Gallup

<li><p>21 This accords with prior work suggesting that more volitional
activities (e.g., eating with others or dining alone) matter more than
life circumstances (e.g., income or age) in predicting wellbeing
(Lyubomirsky et al. 2005b).</p></li>
<li><p>22 A module to capture subjective wellbeing was introduced in the

and those who shared meals are slightly larger for women than for men.

<h2 id="key-insights-2"><strong>Key Insights</strong></h2>
<p><strong>For most people in the world,</strong> family relationships
are an important source of happiness. This chapter explores how the size
and configuration of households – where most family interactions take
place – are associated with people’s happiness.</p>
<p><strong>A household size</strong> of about four members is predictive
of higher happiness levels. People in these households enjoy abundant
and very satisfactory relationships.</p>
<p><strong>People who live on their own</strong> often experience lower
levels of happiness, primarily due to lower levels of relational
satisfaction. People in very large households can also experience less
happiness, probably linked to diminished economic satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>Governments should consider</strong> how economic policies
may have secondary effects on relationships, hence affecting the
wellbeing in families. National statistical offices should prioritise
the development of metrics that assess the quantity and quality of
interpersonal relationships and the bonds that underpin them.</p>
<p><strong>Latin American societies,</strong> characterised by larger
household sizes and strong family bonds, offer valuable lessons for
other societies that seek higher and sustainable wellbeing.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-1"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Caring and sharing – sustained by warm, close, and enduring
relational bonds – are crucial to human happiness.1 In particular,
family bonds promote lasting relationships, and households provide a
context where these bonds develop and, in many cases, thrive.2 Thus, the
field of wellbeing science should pay more attention to household
configurations and intra-household relationships.</p>
<p>This chapter examines the relationship between happiness, household
size, and family configuration. We make extensive use of the rich data
provided by INEGI, the National Statistical Office of Mexico, through
its ENBIARE 2021 survey, as well as additional information from
Colombia. Our analyses contrast the situation in Mexico with that of
European countries, drawing on data from the European Social Survey
2020.</p>
<p>We hypothesise that a small number of household members may limit
affective connections, which negatively impacts happiness, while a large
number of members may impose economic burdens that also threaten
wellbeing. Consequently, the chapter explores the potential existence of
an inverted U-shaped relationship between life satisfaction and the
number of household members. An in-depth analysis of satisfaction across
different life domains suggests that the number of household members is
associated with certain economic costs but also offers broad relational
benefits, such as increased satisfaction with affective life, family,
and personal relationships.3</p>
<p>We also investigate the association between life satisfaction and
various family configurations. The findings indicate that these
configurations significantly influence happiness. For example,
two-parent households are associated with higher levels of life
satisfaction among adult members, while adults living in single-person
and singleparent households tend to experience lower levels of
happiness. The presence of additional family members in single-parent
households appears to mitigate some of the negative effects of
single-parenthood on happiness.</p>
<h2 id="literature-review"><strong>Literature review</strong></h2>
<h4 id="the-family-as-a-central-relational-space"><strong>The family as
a central relational space</strong></h4>
<p>Happiness is nurtured in relational spaces and the family is at the
heart of these connections.4 Caring and sharing are practices that
inherently rely on the presence of and interaction with others,
beginning with family members. The family is where people first learn to
care for and share with others, creating the foundation for broader
social interactions and for wellbeing.5 The family works as a reference
for how people interact with others in their life.6 Families are
associated with close, warm, and genuine relationships that last for
long stretches in people’s journey in life.</p>
<p>Wellbeing researchers have recently been encouraged to adopt a
systemic perspective,7 which has roots in psychology since the late
1950s, particularly in family therapy and family studies.8 Systemic
approaches assert that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts
and that emergent phenomena arise between people who are in
relationships, rather than from out-ofcontext individuals. This
perspective examines how a family’s structure and dynamics influence its
members, recognising that people exist within an emotional ecosystem
where family bonds shape identity and wellbeing. It emphasises that
happiness is not solely individual enjoyment but the shared joy and
caring experienced within relationships.9</p>
<p>Research on subjective wellbeing often emphasises social cohesion,
community involvement, and prosocial behaviours within broader civic
spaces, but the family’s foundational role in shaping these behaviours
is frequently overlooked. By</p>
<p><em>Happiness is not solely individual enjoyment but the shared joy
and caring experienced within relationships.</em></p>
<p><img src="_page_98_Picture_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>acknowledging the influence of family dynamics on prosocial
development, we gain a more comprehensive understanding of how to
enhance wellbeing in societies. Before civic engagement and charitable
activities appear, the family is the space where people start to build
interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p>From a sociological perspective, a family may be conceived as a
social unit or group of people who are related by blood, marriage,
adoption, or other long-term commitments who typically live together and
share economic, emotional, and social activities.10 From a psychological
perspective, families are understood in terms of caring, sharing
gratifying activities, and nurturing and supporting their members which
foster a sense of belonging and identity that significantly contributes
to people’s wellbeing.11 This perspective emphasises emotional bonds,
interpersonal dynamics within the family, and the shared joys and
challenges in life.12</p>
<h4 id="families-and-households"><strong>Families and
households</strong></h4>
<p>Families and households are different both conceptually and
empirically. On the one hand, the concept of family tends to emphasise
kinship ties, socialisation, social roles, nurturing, and the
transmission of culture and values across generations. On the other
hand, a household commonly refers to a group of people, regardless of
their type of relationship, who live together in the same dwelling and
share living arrangements. A household may consist of one person who
lives alone, persons who are not related, or several people with family
bonds. In most cases, households are constituted based on family
ties.</p>
<p>Household size and configuration are commonly determined by the
number of children and the type of coresident family group.13 Household
size and its possible configurations are important for the family
dynamics that may emerge from them, including those relating to caring
and sharing practices and their relationship with happiness.</p>
<h2
id="household-size-family-configurations-and-happiness"><strong>Household
size, family configurations, and happiness</strong></h2>
<p>Mexican data shows the existence of an inverted U-shaped relationship
between life satisfaction and the number of people in a household.14 In
Colombia, the heads of households, spouses in two-parent households, and
especially those who are married, work, and have medium-sized families
(four persons), report the highest levels of happiness.15 Convergent
results have been found in Mexico where university students from
two-parent households show greater levels of self-esteem and life
satisfaction than those living in single-parent households.16 The impact
of family configuration on wellbeing points to the importance of the
quality of interpersonal relationships that are established and
developed in families. In particular, relationships based on affection,
close communication, repeated contact, and mutual support are a source
of family satisfaction and, in turn, life satisfaction as a whole.17</p>
<p>Research on the relationship between family configuration, household
size, and wellbeing offers insights that are relevant to the analyses in
this chapter. First, the size and configuration of families and the
dynamics within them are not innocuous, they affect the happiness of
their members. This is particularly true for marriage bonds,18
parenthood bonds,19 and the number of family members.20 Second, there
are family characteristics, such as the presence of one or two parents,
that have a particularly significant effect on the wellbeing of family
members. Third, life satisfaction is related to the contextual
circumstances of the family – such as the material living conditions and
the family’s life cycle – and to specific characteristics of the parents
or heads of household (age, education, etc.). All these factors are
interrelated and it is not always easy to disentangle their links and
their effects on wellbeing.</p>
<p>While family relationships have historically been viewed as
traditional sources of support,21 it is also important to highlight the
emotional depth and sense of value in family relationships. They are
rooted in mutual affection and companionship that transcend mere
supportive roles and imply</p>
<p><em>Relationships based on affection, close communication, repeated
contact, and mutual support are a source of family satisfaction and, in
turn, life satisfaction as a whole.</em></p>
<p>person-based relationships, where people know each other well and
where the purpose of the relationship is the relationship itself. This
kind of relationship is central to the joint enjoyment of life.22 The
intrinsic value of such relationships lies in the warmth, closeness, and
genuine affection that family members share with each other over long
periods of time. Hence, family relationships are valued not only for
what they provide but, fundamentally, for the quality of the emotional
and meaningful bonds involved. The abundance and quality of family
relationships contribute to people’s happiness and we expect household
size and configuration to contribute to both the quantity and quality of
family relationships.23</p>
<h2
id="household-characteristics-in-latin-america-and-europe"><strong>Household
characteristics in Latin America and Europe</strong></h2>
<p>We now turn to the specific and contrasting characteristics of
households in Latin America and Europe. Figure 4.1 presents the average
household size for many Latin American and European countries taken from
the CORESIDENCE Database.24 Substantial differences are observed between
the two regions. Except for Cuba, Uruguay, and Puerto Rico, the average
household size in Latin America exceeds three people per household, a
size only reached in two European countries: Montenegro and Slovakia.
The average household size exceeds five in Nicaragua and it is fewer
than two in Finland and Denmark.</p>
<p>Linear thinking may suggest that living alone may be better than
living with others, even if it’s more expensive. However, this view
leaves aside the value of interpersonal relationships, which are an
important source of wellbeing and are fostered by sharing the same house
with other people that we care about.25</p>
<p><img src="_page_100_Figure_2.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_101_Figure_2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 4.2 shows the proportion of single-person households in Latin
American and European countries. The proportion ranges from 4% in
Nicaragua to 38% in Denmark.</p>
<p>In Figure 4.3, we compare the distribution of household size between
Mexico and European countries. We observe that single-person households
make up 23% of European households, but that figure is only 11% in
Mexico. In addition, households with two members comprise 34% of
European households and less than 20% in Mexico. Thus, 55% of households
in Europe have two members or fewer, but this figure is about 30% in
Mexico. Furthermore, almost half of Mexican households include four
people or more, while this figure is about 24% for Europe. Mexico is
economically poorer than the average European country. However, larger
households imply a potential advantage to build positive social
interactions within the household, which could partially counterbalance
the differences in income with Europe. This is one of several plausible
explanations for why most Latin American countries report higher
wellbeing than predicted by their GDP per capita.</p>

<h4 id="box-4.1-trends-in-family-configurations"><strong>Box 4.1: Trends
in family configurations</strong></h4>
<p>Over the past 50 years, the composition of families and households
worldwide has undergone significant change.26 The emerging trends raise
significant concerns from a wellbeing perspective as they suggest
increasing threats to both the quantity and quality of person-based
relationships and the role that households play in contributing to
happiness. It is unclear if economic growth can adequately compensate
for these detrimental effects.</p>
<p>Some of the most relevant trends are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Decrease in family size:</strong> Between 1970 and 2020,
the majority of households have decreased by approximately 0.5 persons
per decade on average.27 This global trend is largely explained by the
reduction in the number of children. Fertility rates across the globe
have halved, from 4.84 in 1950 to 2.23 in 2021.28</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rise in single-person households:</strong> They are
becoming widespread in Europe and are growing rapidly in Latin America,
but they are still rare in Africa and most Asian countries.29
Single-person</p></li>
<li><p>households range from 2.6% in Cambodia to 38% in
Switzerland.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rise in single-parent families:</strong> Since the 1990s,
single-mother households have been on the rise in all developing
regions, while single-father households have remained stable.30</p></li>
<li><p>In many parts of the world, <strong>population aging has led to
more multigenerational households</strong>, in which elderly parents
live with their adult children and grandchildren. This change is
particularly prevalent in regions and social sectors where economic
restrictions and cultural norms favour family care for the young and
old.31</p></li>
<li><p>More people are choosing to <strong>live without
children</strong>. Couples without children are prevalent in OECD
countries, ranging from 15% in Poland and Slovenia to 26% in Canada. In
the United States, couples without children (25%) are slightly more
prevalent than couples with children (24%).32</p></li>

surveys from Mexico, Colombia, and several European countries to address
this question, taking advantage of the data available in Mexico to
deepen our understanding of the relationship between life satisfaction
and household size. Figure 4.4 presents average life satisfaction by the
number of members in the household for both Mexico and Europe (note that
these figures differ from the rankings in Chapter 2</p>
<p>as they come from different data sources).33 Our objective is to
analyse how life satisfaction varies with the number of household
members in each region, rather than comparing the regions directly.</p>
<p>In both Mexico and Europe, the highest average life satisfaction is
reported by people who live in households with four to five members. We
also observe an inverted U-shaped relationship. Average life
satisfaction is lower for people in single-person households as well as
households with six or seven members. In Europe, there is a high
wellbeing cost for people in single-person households. While the average
life satisfaction reaches 7.5 for people in households with five
members, it is only 6.6 for people in single-person households. We
should not forget that almost</p>
<p><img src="_page_104_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>24% of households in Europe are single-person. The wellbeing cost for
people in single-person households is also observed in Mexico, but to a
lesser degree than in Europe. It seems that living in single-person
households has a wellbeing cost, but it depends on the context so this
cost varies across regions. For example, it may not be the same to live
in a single-person household when you have close relatives in the
neighbourhood or good friendship ties.34</p>
<h4 id="statistical-analysis-of-household-size"><strong>Statistical
analysis of household size</strong></h4>
<p>We ran regression analyses to delve deeper into the relationship
between household size and life satisfaction in Mexico, taking
socio-economic and demographic characteristics into account. The</p>
<p>regression specification is flexible enough to test the existence of
an inverted U-shaped relationship. The statistical findings are
presented in Table 4.1 in the online appendix.35 It is worth noting that
the coefficients for the number of household members are statistically
significant, although the goodness of fit of the entire model is low,
suggesting that it would be very risky to predict the life satisfaction
of a particular person from their information on assets, education,
gender, age, and number of members in the household.36</p>
<p>Figure 4.5 presents the predicted life satisfaction for different
household sizes based on the estimated coefficients presented in Table
4.1. The predicted value is computed for a woman with average age,
education, and assets, and an inverted U-shaped</p>
<p><img src="_page_105_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>relationship is confirmed. We estimate that the highest life
satisfaction is reached in households of 4 to 5 members, keeping
socio-economic and demographic characteristics constant.37 This figure
is higher than the average household size in Mexico, which is 3.5.
Therefore, from a wellbeing perspective, the current average household
size in Mexico is suboptimal.</p>
<p>We conducted similar regression analyses for the European region
using data from the European Social Survey. Table 4.2 in the online
appendix presents the estimated coefficients for two models.38 Figure
4.6 presents the predicted life satisfaction for different household
sizes based on a woman with average age, education, income, and living
in Belgium.</p>
<p>Figure 4.6 uses the estimated coefficients for the model that
incorporates more countries and observations. Again, we observe an
inverted</p>
<p>U-shaped relationship, regardless of the estimated model. The highest
life satisfaction is achieved with a household size of four members,
well above the current average for European households which is 2.5.
Therefore, from a wellbeing perspective, the current average household
size in European countries seems to be suboptimal too.</p>
<p>This analysis shows two important results for both Mexico and Europe.
First, the current average size of households is below the size
associated with the highest predicted level of life satisfaction for
adults within the region. Second, people who live in single-person or
very large households tend to report lower wellbeing. The reasons for
suboptimal household size are not addressed in this chapter. A deeper
understanding of the inverted U-shaped relationship is obtained by
studying how satisfaction in different life domains relates to household
size.</p>
<p><img src="_page_106_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<h2
id="domains-of-life-explanation-for-the-inverted-u-shaped-relationship"><strong>Domains-of-life
explanation for the inverted U-shaped relationship</strong></h2>
<p>The domains-of-life approach understands life satisfaction as
emerging from satisfaction in specific realms of life.39 The Mexican
ENBIARE survey asks people about their satisfaction in several domains
of life. Here, we consider seven domains: personal relationships, social
life, affective life, family, economic situation, health, and
occupational situation. The first four domains are clearly relational.
Figure 4.7 shows average satisfaction by domain of life. We observe that
satisfaction with family life is quite high in Mexico, with an average
satisfaction above 9, on a scale ranging from 0 (totally unsatisfied) to
10 (totally satisfied). Satisfaction with the economic situation is
relatively low.</p>
<p>How is household size related to satisfaction in these different
domains of life?40 Figure 4.8 presents the predicted satisfaction in
each domain for different household sizes, based on the estimated
coefficients presented in Table 4.3 in the online appendix. The
predicted satisfaction is computed for a woman with sample average age,
education, and assets.</p>
<p>The key insight portrayed by Figure 4.8 is in the relational domains.
An inverted U-shaped relationship is observed in family satisfaction,
where maximum family satisfaction would be reached with a household size
of about six members. This suggests that there are substantial benefits
from living in large households in terms of family satisfaction. The
same situation is observed for satisfaction with affective life, where
maximum satisfaction is reached for about five to</p>
<p><img src="_page_107_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>six household members. Similarly, for the domain of personal
relationships, maximum satisfaction is reached with household members
close to five.</p>
<p>These results suggest there are relational benefits associated with
living in households between four and six members, which is well above
the average household size for Mexico of 3.5 members. Recent research41
shows that, to a certain degree, the size of the household contributes
to generating quality relationships which may be associated with greater
satisfaction with personal relationships, affective life, and family.
There is also evidence that the main variable explaining family
satisfaction is its relational foundation and, in particular, its
affective component, more so than economic factors.42 Thus, the life
satisfaction gains from living in large households seem to be associated
with the important relational benefits associated with large
households.</p>
<p>Our empirical analysis also shows that economic satisfaction is
inversely associated with the number of household members. This finding
suggests that the number of members in the household implies an economic
burden that reduces economic satisfaction, possibly signalling that the
benefits from material resources have to be distributed among a greater
number of household members as household size increases.</p>
<p>The findings presented in Figure 4.8 (and in Table 4.3) pose a
dilemma: small households – and even single-person households – tend to
report higher levels of economic satisfaction. However, small households
report lower satisfaction with their interpersonal relationships. If
economic satisfaction is prioritised, then a small household size offers
advantages. However, people are much more than mere consumers and their
human relationships play a central role in their lives and their
wellbeing.</p>

<h2 id="household-configuration-and-life-satisfaction"><strong>Household
configuration and life satisfaction</strong></h2>
<p>Households are relational spaces and the different types of family
bonds within the household may influence the nature of relationships
and, in consequence, the life satisfaction of household members. This
section focuses on the nature of family bonds within households and how
they are associated with life satisfaction.43</p>
<p>We consider six basic household configurations in the following
analyses (see right).</p>
<p><img src="_page_109_Picture_5.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_110_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>The number of households inhabited by two or more people with no
family ties at all is negligible so they are not considered in this
analysis. All six configurations involve some type of family bond and we
examine the life satisfaction reported by adults who live in one of
these household configurations and were selected to respond to the
ENBIARE or European Social Survey.</p>
<h2
id="descriptive-statistics-of-household-configuration-mexico"><strong>Descriptive
statistics of household configuration (Mexico)</strong></h2>
<p>In Figure 4.9, we present the distribution of the Mexican population
by household configuration and the average life satisfaction associated
with each configuration. Couples with at least one child are the most
frequent household configuration in Mexico, representing almost 38% of
households in the country. People in this type of household</p>
<p>report the highest life satisfaction with an average of 8.6. Life
satisfaction is also relatively high for those who live in households of
couples without children and for those who live in households with a
couple, children, and other relatives. In these cases, the average life
satisfaction is around 8.4. Life satisfaction is relatively low for
people who live in single-person households, in single-parent households
with children, and in single-parent households with children and other
relatives. The presence of extended family has a favourable effect for
single parents with children but seems to be detrimental for couples
with children.</p>
<p>These results suggest that households based around couples report the
highest levels of life satisfaction. This high level of life
satisfaction, combined with a high percentage of these household
configurations, clearly contributes to increased life satisfaction in
Mexico. This is a wellbeing driver that is not frequently considered in
the happiness literature.</p>
<h2
id="statistical-analysis-of-household-configuration-mexico"><strong>Statistical
analysis of household configuration (Mexico)</strong></h2>
<p>We ran regression analyses to study the association between life
satisfaction and family configurations further. The analysis controls by
age, age squared, gender, and educational level of the interviewee, as
well as by assets in the household (as a proxy for the household’s
economic situation). Table 4.4 in the online appendix presents the
estimated coefficients. The category of reference corresponds to a
couple with at least one child.</p>
<p>Figure 4.10 shows the relevant estimated coefficients. The lowest
levels of life satisfaction are associated with single-person and
singleparent households. We also observe significantly lower life
satisfaction among single-parent households, even after adjusting for
the economic situation of the household. However, this observation is
for single-parent households where there are no other family members,
which suggests that the presence of other relatives can mitigate the
wellbeing cost for people who live in singleparent households. Couples
without children report levels of life satisfaction that are
statistically similar to people who live in couples with children.44</p>
<p><img src="_page_111_Figure_5.jpeg" /></p>

<h3 id="domains-of-life-explanation-mexico"><strong>Domains-of-life
explanation (Mexico)</strong></h3>
<p>The domains-of-life approach allows us to delve into the origin of
the wellbeing costs associated with single-person and single-parent
households. We ran regression analyses to study the association of
satisfaction in each domain of life with family configurations,
controlling by age, age squared, gender, education level, and assets in
the household. Table 4.5 in the online appendix shows the estimated
coefficients from the quantitative analyses.</p>
<p>The relevant estimates are presented in Figure 4.11. In comparison to
people living in a couple with at least one child, people living in
single-person households report lower satisfaction in their personal
relationships, affective life, and family life. They also report higher
economic satisfaction but this is not enough to compensate for lower
satisfaction in relational domains. This explains the lower life
satisfaction reported by people in single-person households seen in
Figure 4.10.</p>
<p>Compared to couples with children, people who live in couples without
children have greater economic and affective satisfaction, but lower
satisfaction with health and family. Overall, their life satisfaction is
no different than people who live in couples with children.</p>
<p>People living in couples with children and other relatives report
lower life satisfaction than people living in couples with children.
This lower life satisfaction is explained by lower satisfaction in
almost all the domains of life that were studied.</p>
<p>People who live in single-parent households (with or without other
relatives) report lower life satisfaction than couples with children and
they have lower satisfaction in all the domains of life under
consideration. It is important to note that people in single-parent
households with other relatives report greater life satisfaction than
people in single-parent households with no relatives. This is mostly
explained by their greater satisfaction with affective life and personal
relationships.</p>

<h2
id="descriptive-statistics-of-household-configuration-europe"><strong>Descriptive
statistics of household configuration (Europe)</strong></h2>
<p>The distribution of household configurations in European countries
(Figure 4.12) differs from Mexico (Figure 4.9). The percentage of
singleperson households in Europe (24%) is more than double the number
in Mexico (11%). The situation is similar for couples without children,
28% for Europe and 11% for Mexico. Couples with children represent 25%
of households in Europe, while in Mexico it reaches almost 38%. Couples
with children and other relatives are less than 4% of households in
Europe, while this figure is almost 15% in Mexico. The percentage of
single-parent households is relatively small in Europe (5%) compared to
Mexico (12%), while the percentage of single-parent households with
other relatives is slightly higher in Europe (15%) than in Mexico
(12%).</p>
<p>As we saw in Mexico, there is a life satisfaction cost for
single-person households. A similar situation is observed for
single-parent households with no other relatives. Couples, with or
without children, enjoy the highest level of life satisfaction.</p>
<p>The difference in life satisfaction between people who live in
couples with children and people living alone is much smaller in Mexico
than in Europe (a decline of 0.37 in Mexico vs. a decline of 0.84 in
Europe). In addition, there is a higher percentage of people living
alone in Europe. This combination of factors – the high cost of living
in single-person households and the large percentage of households in
this category – is clearly detrimental to the life satisfaction of
Europeans.45</p>
<h3
id="statistical-analysis-of-household-configuration-europe"><strong>Statistical
analysis of household configuration (Europe)</strong></h3>
<p>We ran regression analyses for European countries using data from the
European Social Survey. The analysis studies the relationship between
life satisfaction and household configurations and controls by age, age
squared, gender, education level, and country fixed effects. Table 4.6
in the online appendix presents the estimated coefficients.</p>
<p>Figure 4.13 shows the relevant coefficients for household
configurations in Europe. Similarly to Mexico, people living in
single-person and singleparent households have lower life
satisfaction</p>
<p>than people who live in couples with children. However, this cost is
larger in Europe than in Mexico. Contextual factors such as the role of
extended family and friendships may explain this difference. People who
live in couples with children and other relatives also have lower life
satisfaction than couples with children and no other relatives. People
who live in single-parent households with other relatives have greater
life satisfaction than single parents who live with no other relatives.
In general, the life satisfaction pattern across household
configurations is very similar in Mexico and Europe.</p>

<p><img src="_page_116_Picture_1.jpeg" /></p>
<h2 id="final-considerations"><strong>Final considerations</strong></h2>
<p>The size and configuration of households are highly relevant for
people’s wellbeing. The household is not only a dwelling. It is a space
for coexistence that favours the emergence of high-quality relationships
which may significantly contribute to life satisfaction. The study of
households often emphasises economies of scale in the use of resources
as well as specialisation in the division of labour. However, the
wellbeing benefits of living together in households are not limited to
economic aspects.</p>
<p>Households are relational spaces – a community of caring and sharing
– where members create strong interpersonal relationships that
contribute to their life satisfaction. Households of two or more people
frequently foster close, genuine, and long-lasting relationships, with
subsequent benefits for life satisfaction.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we show that household size and configuration are
statistically associated with life satisfaction in Mexico and Europe. We
find that</p>
<p>people who live on their own report lower levels of life
satisfaction, and this is not associated with economic reasons. On the
contrary, single-person households report greater economic satisfaction
but lower life satisfaction due to relational deprivation. Controlling
for economic resources, this effect is smaller in Mexico than in Europe,
which suggests that the wellbeing cost experienced</p>
<p><em>In this chapter, we show that household size and configuration
are statistically associated with life satisfaction in Mexico and
Europe. We find that people who live on their own report lower levels of
life satisfaction, and this is not associated with economic
reasons.</em></p>
<p>by those who live on their own may be context dependent. Presumably,
higher average levels of income may help to hide the relatively larger
cost of loneliness to people’s wellbeing.</p>
<p>We present evidence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between
household size and life satisfaction. A household of around four people
has the highest life satisfaction in both Mexico and Europe. Information
from Latin American countries indicate that the quantity (i.e., time
spent with family members) and quality (i.e., sharing emotions,
manifesting affection, communicating, and giving support when facing
challenges) of family relationships is positively associated with
household size. We also find</p>
<p><img src="_page_117_Picture_4.jpeg" /></p>
<p><em>Globalisation and the geographical relocation of production
impose considerable strain on the social fabric, destabilising families
and weakening familial and social bonds.</em></p>
<p>that people who live in single-parent households report lower life
satisfaction. This is mostly explained by their lower satisfaction in
relational domains of life, as well as their lower economic
satisfaction.</p>
<p>Further analyses indicate that the relationship between household
size and life satisfaction is influenced by the extent to which family
members engage in caring and sharing activities.46 Thus, the time spent
together as a family, along with positive emotional exchanges, affective
bonds, genuine interest, communication, and mutual support largely
accounts for the positive link between household size and life
satisfaction. Additional analyses also indicate that household size is
positively associated with access to support.47 This allows us to
conclude that, at least in part, the association between household size
and life satisfaction is mediated by the relevance of household size on
caring and sharing activities.</p>
<p>Household configurations differ across regions, countries, and
decades. Due to these differences, and because household configurations
matter for people’s wellbeing, researchers should take these differences
into account when contrasting life satisfaction between countries and
across time. It is also important to consider these differences even
when contrasting the wellbeing of people living in the same country, as
their household configuration may vary.</p>
<p>Some prevailing social trends are detrimental to the kinds of
household configurations that promote life satisfaction. Indeed, these
trends are often linked to the erosion of relational spaces. Such trends
are intricately tied to economic policies and development strategies
that have, in recent decades, prioritised economic growth while
neglecting the vital role of family relationships and broader social
connections.</p>
<p>These policies aim at economic targets such as investment, exports,
and infrastructure development, yet their consequences extend well
beyond the economic sphere, often being inadequately acknowledged. For
instance, globalisation and the geographical relocation of production
impose considerable strain on the social fabric, destabilising families
and weakening familial and social bonds. The reallocation of resources
is frequently linked to heightened job insecurity which, in turn, can
undermine the quality of family relationships. Moreover, the
deregulation of labour markets and capital movements, while attracting
foreign investment, can also exacerbate job vulnerability and disrupt
work-life balance. Similarly, an educational focus on enhancing human
capital, while crucial for productivity, may overlook the development of
socio-emotional skills that are essential for fostering positive social
interaction.</p>
<p>In this context, social policy has often been conceived as a
palliative measure, designed to address the social problems generated
or, at best, not sufficiently addressed by pro-growth policies. It is
within the realm of social policy to introduce pro-family initiatives,
albeit as a reactive measure rather than as part of a proactive
strategy. Specific pro-family policies, such as initiatives to improve
work-life balance, promote gender equity, and provide maternity or
childcare benefits, attempt to mitigate some of the familial challenges
that negatively impact wellbeing. However, these policies are far less
effective when implemented within a broader and hostile socio-economic
context. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a more comprehensive
reassessment of economic policies – one that recognises the critical
importance of family relationships for overall wellbeing.</p>
<p>Ultimately, societal progress should not be measured by income
levels, but rather by the wellbeing experienced by its members. A more
holistic approach to policy-making, which acknowledges the relevance of
relations and family bonds as a core element of prosperity, is essential
for fostering sustainable, long-term wellbeing.</p>

id="box-4.2-family-the-social-fabric-and-the-crisis-of-violence-in-ciudad-juárez"><strong>Box
4.2: Family, the social fabric, and the crisis of violence in Ciudad
Juárez</strong></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the 21st century, Ciudad Juárez, a Mexican city
on the border with the United States, suffered from an acute crisis of
violence to the point that, with 229 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants
in 2008, it was considered “the most violent city in the world”.48 With
only 1% of the country’s population, Ciudad Juárez concentrated 28% of
the total homicides committed in Mexico. At the same time, it’s youth
were victims and participants in an enormous escalation of violence that
included organised crime, robberies, kidnappings, ‘rent’ collection,
homicides, femicides, and serious problems of domestic violence and
child abuse.</p>
<p>This crisis resulted from the confluence of multiple factors, one of
which was the deterioration of family relationships and community life.
This was a city that based its growth on the export maquiladora
industry, whose viability demanded that large volumes of the working
population migrate from other parts of the country. Those who came to
work in Ciudad Juárez were mostly poorly educated and did not have the
traditional family support networks that they left in their places of
origin. They lacked various social services (e.g., institutional support
for care activities) which encouraged their children to grow up without
adequate guardianship and with emotional deficiencies that made them
more vulnerable to being co-opted by criminal gangs.</p>
<p>This situation coincided with several demographic characteristics of
Ciudad Juárez, in relative terms, such as high frequency of working
women, single mothers, absent fathers, both parents working, smaller
households, and more homes made up of people without family ties. The
growth model followed in Ciudad Juárez focused on the conditioning of
the town for the proper functioning of businesses without considering
the many aspects involved in a more humane model of development. Hence,
there was not an effective policy for promoting healthy family
relationships nor proper institutional and community development
programs that could counterbalance the tendencies towards the
deterioration of the social fabric.49</p>
<p>Perhaps because of the deeply socio-relational origin of the problem,
police actions to address it were ineffective. It was not until the
authorities adopted an holistic approach to rebuild the social fabric
through community work and social participation that the crisis was
contained and reversed.50 This approach focused on education, culture
and sports, the construction or rehabilitation of public spaces,
physical and mental health services, social security protection, support
for local businesses, and attention to addictions among many other
initiatives.</p>
<p>All this highlights the importance of maintaining healthy social ties
so that economic and community progress can be sustained in the long
run. Likewise, it shows there are links between family, community,
public safety and economic spheres, that leaders must be very attentive
to. In turn, this implies that statistical monitoring should not be
limited to material progress. It should also monitor indicators of
subjective wellbeing, with a focus on the quality of family and social
ties. Specifically, it is a reminder to national statistical offices
around the world of the importance of systematically tracking these
types of variables and communicating them in a timely and relevant way
to citizens and policy makers.</p>

areas in Asia (more than half in India and Pakistan), as well as several
in sub-Saharan Africa. This type of household accounts for at least one
in four households in all countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.

in 25 countries, asks the following question regarding life
satisfaction: <em>“All things considered, how satisfied are you with
your life as a whole nowadays? 0 means”extremely dissatisfied” and 10
means “extremely satisfied”</em>. The countries included in the ESS 2020
are: Belgium, Bulgaria, Switzerland, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia,
Finland, France, United Kingdom, Greece, Croatia, Hungary, Ireland,
Iceland, Italy, Lithuania, Latvia, Montenegro, North Macedonia,
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, and Slovakia. Both questions
and the response scales are quite similar. In any case, the empirical
exercise does not compare across regions but explores the variability
within regions.</p></li>
<li><p>34 In a study in the Caldas department of Colombia, Velázquez and
Ramírez (2012) arrived at similar results. The authors found higher
levels of happiness among household heads and partners who live in
households of four members. In this group of households, 69.5% of those
surveyed rated their happiness as high or very high, which exceeds the
levels reached in households with two, three, five and more members
(between 60.0% and 65.8%) and particularly higher than single-person
households (51.5%).</p></li>
<li><p>35 OLS regressions are run. Life satisfaction is treated as
cardinal. An alternative ordered-probit model was tested. The main
conclusions of the research sustain when life satisfaction is treated as
ordinal rather than cardinal.</p></li>
<li><p>36 All the econometric models are run based on raw (unweighted)
sample data. For the case of Mexico, the models were also run based on a
weighted (expanded) version of the data. Both versions show very similar
results.</p></li>
<li><p>37 The control variables are age, age squared, gender, education
level, and a constructed assets variable, which refers to the existence
of the following goods and services in the household: refrigerator,
washing machine, automobile, television, computer, video game, access to
the internet, and access to any music and/or video streaming
service.</p></li>
<li><p>38 In this case, household income information is available for a
group of European countries. Therefore, two models are run, one that
includes income but relies on a smaller number of observations, and
another that does not include income but uses a greater number of
observations.</p></li>
<li><p>39 Recommendations about the domains of life and their
demarcation can be found in the OECD Guidelines on Measuring Subjective
Well-being (OECD, 2013).</p></li>
<li><p>40 Regression analyses similar to the one presented in Figure 4.5
(Table 4.1 of the online appendix) are followed. Satisfaction in the
different life domains is the dependent variable. A quadratic
specification for the number of household members is included and
control variables in the regression are: age, age squared, gender,
education level, and assets.</p></li>

<li><p>42 Millán and Esteinou (2021).</p></li>
<li><p>43 The ENBIARE survey defines a household as one in which one or
more people live and share the costs and preparation of their meals.
There may be cases where people physically share the same household, but
do not participate in either spending on or preparing food (or do not do
so all the time). There may also be households in which several families
live, each sharing the cost and preparation of their food independently,
but not necessarily together (or not all the time). Given the number of
cases in these situations, the percentages are considered to be
negligible for the purposes of the analysis conducted here.</p></li>
<li><p>44 It is important to note that the same econometric exercise was
applied to information that comes from two other reliable sources: the
quarterly subjective wellbeing survey applied by the national statistics
office of Mexico (INEGI) since 2014, known as BIARE Básico or Basic
BIARE, and the quality-of-life survey applied by the national statistics
office of Colombia (DANE) in 2023. In both cases, the results obtained
are similar to those presented in Figure 4.10.</p></li>
<li><p>45 The proportion of single-person households in Europe (24%) may
be one of the factors behind the so-called loneliness epidemic in some
European countries (Baarck et al., 2022). Despite its importance, to
explore this possibility lies outside the scope of our analysis
here.</p></li>
<li><p>46 These analyses rely on information from the Understanding
Happiness in Latin America survey, which involves three Latin American
countries: Colombia, Costa Rica, and Mexico.</p></li>
<li><p>47 These analyses are based on information from ENBIARE 2021 and
consider the following variables: 1) considering that one can always
count on the help of family members, 2) caring for or attending to
family members who could not take care of themselves, 3) helping
household members with their schoolwork or taking them to school, 4)
frequency with which one usually has meetings with family members and 5)
frequency with which one usually has meetings with friends of one’s
partner.</p></li>

and included many social measures. The strategy was called <em>Todos

<h2
id="social-connection-is-vital-for-the-wellbeing-of-young-adults"><strong>Social
connection is vital for the wellbeing of young adults:</strong></h2>
<p>Social connection buffers people from the toxic effects of stress and
significantly enhances subjective wellbeing during young adulthood.</p>
<p><strong>Social disconnection is prevalent and increasing among young
adults:</strong> In 2023, 19% of young adults across the world reported
having no one that they could count on for social support, representing
a 39% increase compared to 2006.</p>
<h2
id="early-social-ties-during-young-adulthood-have-long-lasting-effects"><strong>Early
social ties during young adulthood have long-lasting
effects:</strong></h2>
<p>For university students, forming friendships in the first few weeks
of college can increase the likelihood of flourishing and reduce the
likelihood of developing depressive symptoms over the subsequent
years.</p>
<p><strong>Many young adults underestimate their peers’
empathy,</strong> leading them to avoid connecting with others and miss
out on opportunities for meaningful relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Interventions can bridge this ‘empathy perception
gap’:</strong> Field interventions that teach young adults about the
empathy and care of their community can promote social connection.
Undergraduate students exposed to these interventions see others as more
empathic and are more likely to make new connections and build larger
social networks.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-2"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Young adults across the globe face increasing mental health
challenges. Once considered one of the happiest phases of life, young
adulthood has taken a troubling turn.1 Young people in North America and
Western Europe now report the lowest wellbeing among all age groups. In
fact, <em>World Happiness Report 2024</em> found that the fall in the
United States’ happiness ranking was largely due to a precipitous
decline in wellbeing among Americans under 30.2</p>
<p>This chapter centres on a key idea that illuminates the problem of
low wellbeing among young adults and potential ways to reverse it:
happiness is fundamentally social. Across cultures and generations,
supportive relationships buoy mental health and happiness.3 Social ties
also buffer people from the toxic effects of stress,4 reducing the risk
that subclinical difficulties will escalate into mood disorders.5</p>
<p>But during the same period in which young adult wellbeing has
declined, loneliness among this population has risen. A comprehensive
analysis including 437 independent samples of young adults found that
loneliness in this population has steadily increased over the past four
decades.6 This trend was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, with
young adults reporting greater feelings of loneliness compared to other
age groups during that time. Even after the pandemic, contrary to
expectations, young adult loneliness did not return to pre-pandemic
levels. The US National College Health Association’s 2023 annual survey
found that <em>half</em> of college undergraduates reported significant
loneliness, representing a 4.7% increase compared to 2019.7 Amidst busy
campuses and despite a world saturated with instant communication, young
people today report feeling increasingly distressed while lacking the
connections that can help their psychological wellbeing.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we begin by presenting recent global patterns in
social connection and wellbeing among young adults. Next, we review both
classic and current research on community wellbeing, with a particular
focus on young adults across the globe. We then zoom in on a
large-scale,</p>
<p>longitudinal project we have led, which explores social connection
and wellbeing among multiple cohorts of one undergraduate student
community across their four years at university. Data from this work
advance the basic science of community wellbeing and provide avenues to
improve it. We conclude by discussing open questions and how these
research findings can inform policy to support the wellbeing of young
adults worldwide.</p>
<h2
id="recent-trends-in-wellbeing-and-social-connection-among-young-adults"><strong>Recent
trends in wellbeing and social connection among young
adults</strong></h2>
<p>In this chapter, we define young adults as individuals in the age
range of 18 to 29, a period that marks the transition from late
adolescence to adulthood. This life period is often accompanied by
significant environmental changes as well as psychosocial developments.8
During this time, many young adults leave home for education, work,
romantic relationships, or personal growth. On the other hand, many
young adults — especially in parts of Eastern Europe and East Asia9 —
continue living with their parents. This pattern has become increasingly
common in other countries such as the United States, reflecting
increasing economic challenges for the young generation.10 Contemporary
cohorts of young adults have also grown up alongside significant
societal developments which have changed the nature of human
relationships, such as changes in communication due to social media and,
more recently, large language models such as ChatGPT.11 These
experiences may add to young adults’ vulnerability to both loneliness
and mental health difficulties.</p>
<p><em>As young adults strive for independence and transition to become
less reliant on their family, they place greater emphasis on acquiring
new friendships and expanding their social circles.</em></p>
<p>In addition to changes in their environment, young adulthood is
accompanied by important developmental milestones, including the
establishment of new personal and professional relationships.12 As young
adults strive for independence and transition to become less reliant on
their family,13 they place greater emphasis on acquiring new friendships
and expanding their social circles.14 Historically, young adulthood has
been one of the most social periods of life, as young adults tend to
form more friendships and spend more time socialising than people in
other age groups. In addition to fulfilling social needs, young adult
relationships lay the foundation for psychological and social growth in
later life stages, providing a network of support that can sustain
wellbeing and resilience in years to come.15 However, as we will
explore, young adults have also faced a disproportionate decline in
social connection in recent years, potentially impacting their
wellbeing</p>
<h4 id="defining-social-connection"><em>Defining social
connection</em></h4>
<p>Social connection is a multifaceted construct that captures different
aspects of how we relate to others. As shown in Table 5.1, it includes
three dimensions: quantity, quality, and structure. Each of these
dimensions plays a distinct role in shaping our wellbeing, offering
unique pathways for fostering connection, belongingness, and
support.</p>

<p>To explore wellbeing and social connection among young adults, we

geographies. The GFS covers a robust set of measures on wellbeing,
health, social, economic, political, religious, spiritual,

<p>Notably, the GFS includes questions assessing the quantity and
quality of respondents’ social connections. For the quantity of social
connection, participants were asked whether they had at least one
special person in their life that they felt very close to. This measure,
framed as a yes-or-no choice, does not capture the full range in the
quantity of a person’s connection, but it does help to identify people
experiencing deep social isolation. With regard to the quality of social
connection, participants rated the extent to which they could rely on
other people in their lives for support when they needed help, using a
scale from 0 (never) to 10 (always). The structure of individuals’
social networks, such as density, was not assessed in the GFS.</p>
<p>We also draw on the Gallup World Poll (GWP) to explore the temporal
trends of social connection among young adults. The GWP dataset offers
valuable insight into the quality of social connection by asking
respondents whether they can count on their relatives or friends for
support when they are in trouble. Importantly, the GWP has been tracking
respondents on this measure for over a decade, allowing us to
characterise changes in young adult social connection globally. Here, we
utilise GWP data from 2006 to 2023, including over 661,000 observations
from 168 countries.</p>
<h4 id="regional-patterns-of-social-connection"><strong>Regional
patterns of social connection</strong></h4>
<p>We begin by examining the current state of the quantity and quality
of social connection among young adults across countries, and then
compare the state of social connection across age groups. Data from the
GFS demonstrate that while most young adults report having at least one
social connection, a significant number are socially isolated. Across
the 22 countries and regions, 17% of the young adult population report
not having anybody (including family and friends) that they feel close
to (Figure 5.1A). Japan stands out starkly, with over 30% of the young
adult population reporting social isolation. In contrast, in countries
such as Nigeria, Egypt, and the Philippines, less than 10% of the young
adult population report having no close relationships.</p>
<p>Countries also varied in the quality of social connection reported by
young adults. Participants rated how often they could count on people in
their lives, such as relatives or friends, to provide help whenever
needed. Overall, about 76% of young adults in the GFS sample reported
that they can often count on people in their life for social support
(indicated by a rating of 5 or higher on a 0–10 scale). Israel ranks the
highest in the quality of social connections, followed closely by Mexico
and Argentina (Figure 5.1B), indicating that young adults in these
countries generally feel confident about the availability of help. By
contrast, young adults in Japan and Türkiye report the lowest levels of
social support.</p>
<p>In Figure 5.2, we compare the social connection of young adults with
other age groups. Consistent</p>
<p><img src="_page_131_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>with previous observations,17 adults older than 45 years report lower
quantity of social connection compared to younger adults, representing
higher levels of social isolation. For quality of social connection, the
pattern follows a U-shaped curve, with both young adults (&lt;30 years)
and older adults (&gt;60 years) reporting higher levels of social
support. These patterns likely reflect the shifting priorities that come
with age. Young adults often focus on expanding their social networks,
while older adults may prioritise fewer but emotionally closer
relationships, optimising their connections to benefit subjective
wellbeing.<sup>18</sup></p>
<p>Despite the overall trend that young adults report higher social
connection than older adults, countries vary on the age-related
differences in the quantity of social connection (Figure 5.3A). For
example, this pattern is flipped in the United States, Japan, and
Australia, where young adults</p>
<p>report the lowest social connection among all age groups. In the
United States, 18% of young adults (aged 18–29) reported not having
anyone that they feel close to, whereas 15% of adults aged 30–44
reported no social connection.</p>
<p>Unlike other nations, young adults in the US also report lower
quality of connection than other age groups (Figure 5.3B). Mirroring
these patterns, <em>World Happiness Report 2024</em> also highlighted a
decline in the US happiness ranking, largely driven by a drop in
wellbeing in the young adult age group.19 Although not definitive, this
provides intriguing preliminary evidence that relatively low connection
among young people might factor into low wellbeing among young
Americans.</p>

<h3
id="temporal-trends-of-social-connection-among-young-adults"><strong>Temporal
trends of social connection among young adults</strong></h3>
<p>Recent reports suggest that young adults are experiencing a decline
in social connection and a rise in loneliness.20 Yet, our analysis of
the GFS dataset showed that young adults are more socially connected
compared to older age groups. At first glance, these findings may seem
contradictory, but examining the data over time provides helpful
context. If young adults in the past were even more socially integrated
than they are now, this age group could face increasing isolation while
still remaining more connected than older adults. In this section, we
explore this possibility using the Gallup World Poll (GWP) dataset,
which includes data from young adults across 168 countries from 2006 to
2023.</p>
<p>First, we observed an overall decrease in the quality of social
connection among young adults over time (Figure 5.4A). Each year, an
additional 0.1% of young adults reported not having anyone that they
could count on. This may seem negligible, but globally it represents 1.7
million more young adults reporting they have no one to count on each
year.</p>
<p>Next, we explore these trends within the 22 countries in the GFS
survey (Figure 5.4B). Some countries (especially Tanzania) demonstrated
significant decreases, mirroring the global trend. Yet, three countries
(Mexico, India, and Egypt) bucked this trend, showing significant
increases in the quality of social connection among young adults during
this period.</p>
<p>As described above, young adults could be losing social connection
over time but still remain more connected than older adults, which would
be reflected in a shrinking age gap in connectedness. Indeed, when
comparing the difference in the quality of social connection between
young adults (18–29) and older adults (60+), this gap has decreased over
the last 17 years (Figure 5.5). In 2006, young adults were 6% more
likely than older adults to report having someone to rely on. However,
since 2020, the difference between the two groups has fallen to less
than 1%. This indicates that the decrease in quality of social
connection is specific to young adults, and not observed across age
groups.</p>

<h2
id="social-connection-and-wellbeing-among-young-adults"><strong>Social
connection and wellbeing among young adults</strong></h2>
<p>So far, we explored temporal and regional patterns of social
connection in young adults. Next, we examine the relationship between
social connection and subjective wellbeing within the GFS dataset. In
the GFS, subjective wellbeing was measured with the following life
satisfaction question: “How satisfied are you with life as a whole these
days?” Responses were rated on a scale from 0 (not at all satisfied) to
10 (completely satisfied). We find that countries where young adults
report general higher levels of social connection and social support
also report higher life satisfaction (Figure 5.6). This relationship was
independently observed for both quantity and quality of social
connection.</p>
<p>The link between social connection and wellbeing is not only observed
at the national level but also for individuals. On average, young adults
who report higher levels of both quantity and quality of social
connection tend to feel more satisfied with their lives. Individuals who
reported having at least one person they are close to are 16% more
satisfied than individuals with no close contacts.21</p>
<p>In a few countries which scored highest on social connection (such as
Nigeria and Egypt) we do not observe significant associations between
social connection and wellbeing (Figure 5.7).</p>
<p><img src="_page_138_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_138_Figure_2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>For example, over 90% of young adults in Egypt reported having at
least one person that they feel close to. Because only a small
proportion of this group reports lacking social connection, it’s
difficult to relate social connection with wellbeing among this
group.</p>
<p>Similarly, we observe a significant positive association between the
quality of social connection and wellbeing. A 1-point increase in
perceived social support is associated with a 0.29-point increase in
life satisfaction.22 Data from all 22 countries and regions in the GFS
data showed a positive association, although the size of this positive
association varied slightly across countries.</p>
<p>When these two factors of social connection are entered in the same
model to predict life satisfaction, both the quantity and quality of
social connection were significantly associated with life satisfaction,
with comparable effect sizes.23 This result indicates that the quantity
and quality of social connection independently predict life
satisfaction.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we present further evidence on the links
between social connection and happiness, as well as the potential
barriers preventing young people from fostering connections.</p>

tracking of young adult social connection</strong></h2>
<p>Social connection correlates with wellbeing both among individuals
and across countries. These correlations raise an important question
regarding causality: do healthy social relationships <em>lead</em> to
greater wellbeing, or does feeling happy make people seek out social
connections, or are these both true?24 To characterise the direction of
these relationships, it is important to go beyond measuring connection
and wellbeing at a moment in time. For instance, researchers can track
the same individuals over time to see if social connection predicts
better wellbeing in the future, or if the reverse is true. Studies that
take this approach indeed find that when people are socially connected,
they are more likely to thrive in the future.</p>
<p>Consider the Harvard Adult Development Study, a long-running research
project that investigates</p>
<p><em>Studies that take this approach indeed find that when people are
socially connected, they are more likely to thrive in the
future.</em></p>
<p>how individuals’ health and wellbeing evolved as they grew up.25 This
program started in 1938 with 724 university students. Researchers
continue to monitor the wellbeing of the original participants who are
in their late 90s now. Over the years, the project expanded to include
larger cohorts of participants. For over 80 years, researchers have
tracked the participants’ lives, collecting data on their health,
relationships, and overall wellbeing through periodic interviews and
medical checkups. One of the study’s most significant findings is the
importance of social relationships for long-term happiness and health.
Researchers found that the people who stayed the healthiest and lived
the longest tended to be those who had the strongest connections to
others. For example, close relationships were found to delay mental and
physical decline, and were better predictors of long and happy lives
than social class, IQ, or even genetic factors.26</p>
<p>Other studies with wider population samples have also found a similar
link. Social connection predicts later increases in life satisfaction
and this holds after controlling for a wide range of demographic
variables and stress.27 In one study, using a large representative
survey in Germany, researchers asked participants to report on their
ideas for how they could improve their life satisfaction. The
researchers then investigated which ideas predicted changes in life
satisfaction one year later. The researchers found that those who had
socially engaged goals (e.g., “I plan to spend more time with friends
and family”) often reported improvements in life satisfaction one year
later. In contrast, those who had other goals (e.g., “I plan to find a
better job”) did not report increased life satisfaction.28</p>
<p>Social relationships are also significant predictors of wellbeing in
longitudinal analyses of young adults specifically. In one study,
researchers tracked 393 US students across their four years of
university on a number of social factors as well as life satisfaction.29
Students who were more extroverted reported higher life satisfaction
four years later, in part because they formed stronger social
connections in the university. In addition to social connection, several
studies conducted across cultures including the US, Portugal,</p>
<p><em>You might expect that extroverts would derive greater joy from
social interactions, but evidence suggests that both extroverts and
introverts derive happiness from social interactions, but for different
reasons.</em></p>
<p>Germany, Russia, and China found that students who report receiving
more social support also reported higher wellbeing later in
college.30</p>
<p>In addition to tracking individuals over long periods of time, recent
studies have captured data over shorter but more intensive periods, such
as days or weeks. This is done by briefly surveying participants
multiple times per day (an approach called ‘experience sampling’) or
passively collecting data from individuals (such as background sound
from their mobile phone, an approach called ‘passive sensing’). For
example, researchers sometimes ‘ping’ participants throughout the day to
assess their behaviour (e.g., whether the participant engaged in a
social interaction) and whether they feel happy at that moment. These
studies find that people generally feel happier after they engage in
social interactions.</p>
<p>Experience sampling also allows researchers to examine <em>who</em>
benefits most from social interactions. For example, you might expect
that extroverts would derive greater joy from social
interactions,<sup>31</sup> but evidence suggests that both extroverts
and introverts derive happiness from social interactions, but for
different reasons. Extroverts tend to experience a boost in mood after
spending time with others. Introverts, on the other hand, tend to feel a
stronger sense of connectedness after interactions, especially when
those conversations are meaningful and deep.32</p>
<p>Experience sampling can also reveal <em>when</em> social interactions
improve wellbeing. In one recent study, Krämer and colleagues tracked
Germanspeaking participants with experience sampling and passive mobile
sensing. Participants generally felt happier after social interactions,
but this was</p>
<p><em>These studies provide robust evidence that people feel increased
happiness after connecting and interacting with others.</em></p>
<p>only the case when the social interactions were aligned with their
needs. For example, when people were socially interacting while desiring
to be alone, they experienced decreases in happiness. On the other hand,
when individuals deliberately engage in social interactions to seek
comfort, celebrate, or commiserate, these connections tend to increase
wellbeing.33</p>
<p>There is strong evidence that social connection is followed by
greater happiness, but what about the reverse? Does being happy lead
people to seek the company of other people? The relationship between
happiness and social behaviour appears to be more nuanced. People do
tend to report feeling more social when they are in a happier mood,34
but they also tend to seek contact with others in times of distress.35
This pattern suggests that we turn to others for different reasons
depending on how we feel. When we are feeling down, we may seek out
happiness-enhancing social relationships. On the other hand, when we are
feeling good, we might be more willing to share this happiness with
others or invest in less enjoyable social interactions – like resolving
conflicts or developing new relationships – that could bring long-term
benefits.<sup>36</sup></p>
<p>Together, these studies provide robust evidence that people feel
increased happiness after connecting and interacting with others. While
these studies help us understand the correlation between social
connection and happiness, it is important to note that they cannot
establish social connection as the sole reason causing this positive
boost in mood.</p>
<h3
id="causal-links-between-social-connection-and-wellbeing"><strong>Causal
links between social connection and wellbeing</strong></h3>
<p>Examining social interaction and happiness across people, or within
people over time, provides intriguing links between these experiences.
But to better understand if social interaction <em>causes</em> greater
wellbeing, scientists need to conduct experiments that randomly assign
participants to engage in social connection or not. One specific type of
social behaviour, prosocial behaviour, has already been covered in
Chapter 4 of <em>World Happiness Report 2023</em>. 37 But can other
forms of social connection help protect against the harmful effects of
stress and elevate happiness?</p>
<p>In difficult times, social connections act as a protective shield
against the harmful effects of stress.38 A series of experimental
studies from the past two decades provide evidence that receiving social
support (compared to no support) can buffer the negative impact of
stressful events. These studies generally put participants under
distress, such as applying a mild electric shock or giving a speech in
front of others, and record participants’ stress levels under different
experimental circumstances.</p>
<p>In a series of classic experiments,39 young adult participants were
randomly assigned to deliver a speech either with or without access to
social support. Participants in the social support condition exhibited
lower blood pressure, a physiological indicator of stress, compared to
those who did not have access to social support. This suggests that the
presence of social support can mitigate physiological stress responses
during stressful tasks.</p>
<p>More recent studies corroborate this effect with brain evidence. In
one experiment, young adults received mild electric shocks while their
brain activity was recorded in a fMRI scanner.40 Each participant
received these shocks either alone or when holding hands with an
opposite-sex companion, such as a friend or romantic partner. Overall,
when participants were holding hands, they rated the experience as less
distressing and exhibited less activity in brain regions associated with
the experience of threat.</p>
<p><img src="_page_142_Picture_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Even when people cannot directly access their support systems, simply
imagining the presence of a caring friend or loved one can soothe the
distress of experimentally-induced pain.41 In one experiment,
participants viewed a picture of a loved one while experiencing mild
pain from heat stimulation. Compared to viewing a picture of an object,
seeing the photo of a loved one reduced their pain perception just as
much as physically holding a partner’s hand.</p>
<p>In addition to dampening stress, social interactions can be a
powerful driver of happiness too.42 When the adventurer Christopher
McCandless faced his own eventual death after months alone in the
Alaskan wilderness, one of his last reflections was “happiness is only
real when shared”.43 While his experience may be extreme, people do tend
to share their joyful moments with others to elevate happiness – a
process called capitalisation.44 For example, compared to those who
wrote about a positive event privately, or shared this event with
unresponsive peers, participants who shared this event with responsive
others reported these events to be more positive and personally
meaningful,</p>
<h2 id="happiness-is-only-real-when-shared."><em>Happiness is only real
when shared.</em></h2>
<p>demonstrating the power of social sharing in enhancing happiness and
meaning.45</p>
<p>The benefits of social interaction go beyond sharing good news with
friends and family. Even general interactions with strangers, though
potentially nerve-wracking, can spark joy. In one study, some university
students were instructed to either spend 30 minutes interacting with
peers they did not know or to stop interacting whenever they wanted and
to spend the remaining time sitting in solitude.46 Students who were
assigned to interact with strangers for the entire 30 minutes enjoyed
the time more than participants who were allowed to spend some of the
time in solitude. Thus, even brief interaction with strangers can
elevate happiness.</p>
<p>30-minute conversations with strangers might be rare, but our
day-to-day lives are filled with brief encounters: thanking the barista
preparing our morning coffee, asking someone for directions, or
exchanging a few words with a fellow commuter on a bus. Would something
as simple as saying “hi” or “have a nice day” to these strangers
contribute to happiness? Research on these “minimal social interactions”
shows that even small exchanges with strangers can enhance happiness. In
a study involving 265 Turkish university students and staff, the
students who were asked to thank, greet, or express good wishes to their
shuttle bus drivers experienced greater happiness than those who were
asked to not speak with the drivers.47 Similar effects were observed for
bus and train commuters who were instructed to interact with a fellow
commuter,48 as well as customers at Starbucks who were instructed to
have a brief social interaction with the barista, compared to those who
were not asked to interact.49 Together, these findings underscore that
even brief interactions with strangers can buoy happiness.</p>
<p>Going beyond a single instance of socialising, a few studies have
examined how being social for weeks can impact long-term happiness. For
instance, one study investigated the benefits of acting more
extroverted.50 114 Australian adults were randomly assigned either to
act more extroverted (bold, outgoing, and talkative) or more introverted
(quiet, sensitive, and calm) for a week. Those who acted extroverted
experienced more positive moods compared to those who acted introverted.
Even individuals who were more introverted by nature experienced more
positive emotions when they acted more outgoing. Interestingly, this
improvement in happiness was not due to more social interactions, but
because of the way people behaved during them.</p>
<h3 id="a-network-science-approach-to-social-connection"><strong>A
network science approach to social connection</strong></h3>
<p>The evidence and data reviewed so far concern direct connections
between people. Yet, our social world extends beyond our direct
connections. A wealth of research reveals that the structure of a
person’s social network – the way that their relationships are organised
– is also associated with wellbeing. These studies often employ a
network science approach,51 where individuals (or ‘nodes’) in the social
network are connected by relationships (or ‘ties’) to form complex
networks of social relationships. This type of diagram intuitively
characterises how people connect and allows researchers to develop
precise mathematical metrics that capture the structural composition of
these networks. Such metrics can reveal important insights into
someone’s social world that would otherwise remain hidden, offering a
more nuanced picture of how our social worlds may shape our capacity to
thrive.</p>
<p>One network metric is <em>density</em>, the level of
interconnectedness between nodes in a social network (Figure 5.8).52
People who are situated in dense social networks tend to be less lonely
and happier,53 perhaps because these dense connections offer a sense of
security, stability, and belonging.</p>
<p>In one recent study, researchers interviewed 2,485 individuals in
Indiana, USA across three years during the COVID-19 pandemic.54 In
addition to wellbeing measures, they also assessed characteristics of
the participants’ social networks, such as size, closeness, and density.
Overall, young adults were disproportionately affected by the pandemic,
reporting larger drops in wellbeing compared to other age groups.
Interestingly, young adults with more dense and interconnected social
networks experienced smaller decreases in wellbeing compared to those
with sparser networks. This buffering effect of social network density
was stronger for young adults compared to other age groups.</p>
<p>Another aspect of social network characteristics that may contribute
to mental health is <em>diversity</em>, the extent to which individuals
connect with different groups of people. Diverse networks, which include
a mix of close family ties and different types of peers (e.g., members
of the</p>
<p><em>Interacting across group boundaries – such as differences in race
or socioeconomic status – further amplifies these benefits.</em></p>
<p><img src="_page_144_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>orchestra, track team, and culinary club), can protect against
depression and other mental illnesses.55 Interacting across group
boundaries – such as differences in race or socioeconomic status –
further amplifies these benefits. These connections foster a sense of
belonging and can help reduce feelings of exclusion, especially for
individuals from minority groups.56</p>
<p>A recent analysis including over 24,000 adults in England paints a
nuanced relationship between social network diversity and subjective
wellbeing.<sup>57</sup> While some level of network homophily
(similarity between contacts) is linked with better wellbeing, social
networks that are excessively homogeneous can undermine happiness. This
finding underscores that a balance between homophily and diversity –
combining in-group familiarity and out-group variety – may offer the
greatest advantages and enhance subjective wellbeing.</p>
<p>In summary, work in this area so far demonstrates that the quantity
and quality of social connections,</p>
<p>along with the structure of social networks, shape wellbeing. Social
networks that are dense and diverse can offer psychological security,
belongingness, and opportunities for growth, all of which can elevate
subjective wellbeing.</p>
<h2 id="an-in-depth-study-of-one-young-adult-community"><strong>An
in-depth study of one young adult community</strong></h2>
<p>The evidence we have reviewed so far provides strong support for the
old proverb: “shared joy is a double joy; shared sorrow is half sorrow.”
Yet, recent studies and our new analysis paint a sobering picture: young
adults globally are lonelier than before.58</p>
<p>While young adulthood is expected to be one of the happiest and most
social life stages, young adults in the US reported the lowest happiness
and social connection of all age groups. If social connection is so
beneficial, why are young adults not connecting more? Answering this
question will require more in-depth assessment of young adults’ beliefs
and attitudes towards their community. This section presents insights
from our large-scale, longitudinal project, the Stanford Communities
Project (SCP).</p>
<p>The goal of the SCP is to provide a detailed assessment of the social
health of one young adult community. Since 2018, the project has
assessed thousands of Stanford undergraduates, multiple times a year, to
gather data on personality traits, wellbeing, social networks, and
momentary assessments of social activity. The SCP provides a novel and
comprehensive means to examine perceptions, social behaviour, and mental
health in a young adult population. So far, the findings from this
project underscore the profound impact of social connection on happiness
and wellbeing, but they also highlight a critical gap: young people
experience diminished connection when they perceive their peers as less
empathic than their peers self-report. By examining this ‘perception
gap’ and trying to reduce it, we can better understand how to foster
meaningful connections and support the wellbeing of young adults.</p>
<h3
id="early-social-ties-have-long-lasting-effects-on-wellbeing"><strong>Early
social ties have long-lasting effects on wellbeing</strong></h3>
<p>As we reviewed above, scientists often track individuals over time to
uncover the longitudinal link between social connection and wellbeing.
The SCP did the same by following two cohorts of undergraduate students
(N = 1,061) across their college years. Twice a year, we assessed
changes in the students’ friendships and wellbeing and found five
distinct wellbeing trajectories that students followed during college.
For example, some students experienced improving wellbeing (‘getting
better’), and others experienced worsening wellbeing (‘getting worse’).
Notably, 38% of students followed the ‘getting worse’ trajectory, where
symptoms of depression intensified over the course of college.</p>
<p>We found that the number of social ties a student forms in their
first few weeks of college predicts the long-term trajectory in the
subsequent years. Every additional friendship was associated with a
significant reduction in the likelihood of ’getting</p>
<p>worse’ compared to ‘getting better’. This highlights the protective
role of social connection during a critical time of transition.</p>
<p>The impact of friendships lasted well beyond those first few weeks.
Across the college years, friendships change in interesting and
meaningful ways, shaping the wellbeing trajectories that students may
follow. Each new friendship increases the likelihood of ‘getting better’
by 17%. On the other hand, losing a friendship increases the chances of
falling into a ‘getting worse’ trajectory by 19%. These findings add to
existing evidence that stronger social connections are usually followed
by better wellbeing down the road.</p>
<h3
id="cohesive-social-microclimates-support-wellbeing"><strong>Cohesive
‘social microclimates’ support wellbeing</strong></h3>
<p>An individual’s direct friendships contribute to their wellbeing. As
we have seen, existing evidence suggests that tight-knit social circles
can offer a sense of security and belonging, thus promoting mental
health. But what happens when we zoom out to consider the larger social
ecosystem that students inhabit? Each person resides in a unique ‘social
microclimate’, characterised by the emotional traits of friends and
community members, as well as the relationships among neighbours. Unlike
direct friendships, a young adult’s social microclimate is often beyond
their control. Yet, various features of this microclimate can
significantly affect their subjective wellbeing.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, our team leveraged an assignment process
that many universities use for student housing.59 At Stanford
University, all first-year students were assigned to residential halls.
This offers a unique opportunity to study how social microclimates shape
wellbeing while</p>
<p><em>Unlike direct friendships, a young adult’s social microclimate is
often beyond their control. Yet, various features of this microclimate

<p><img src="_page_146_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>controlling for the confounding factor of individuals selecting their
own social groups. Since students did not choose who would live in the
same hall with them, the researchers could isolate the effect of the
broader social ecosystem from the effects of the direct, personal
connections.</p>
<p>We collected data from 798 first-year students and assessed their
personal traits, such as emotional stability and empathy, before the
students arrived on campus. Midway through their first term, students
were asked to report their subjective wellbeing and nominated their
friends. This allowed us to capture two types of social factors. The
first type consists of a student’s direct social network: how many
friends they had and how supportive and empathic those friends were. The
second type concerns the social microclimate, which includes not only
direct personal ties, but also the hallmates that the student is not
directly friends with. For instance, we measured the overall density of
social connections within each</p>
<p>hall. A hall with high density would have many students nominating
each other as friends, creating a more cohesive microclimate (Figure
5.9A).</p>
<p>The results showed that these social factors significantly influenced
wellbeing. Consistent with the evidence reviewed above, attributes of a
student’s direct social network are significantly associated with
subjective wellbeing. Moreover, the density of a student’s social
microclimate also plays a significant role in mental health. Students
who lived in high-density halls, where community members are more
interconnected, reported lower levels of psychological distress and
higher life satisfaction (Figure 5.9B). These effects remained robust
even after accounting for individual traits and characteristics of one’s
direct social network. Thus, the density and cohesion of a student’s
social microclimate may also shape subjective wellbeing, as well as
their immediate social network.</p>

in social perceptions hinder social connection and
wellbeing</strong></h2>
<p>Close friendships and cohesive communities buoy happiness. Yet, even
in supportive communities, people can still feel isolated and hesitate
to reach out to others. As we described above, feelings of loneliness
for young adults have increased by an average of 0.22% per year for the
past four decades,60 and the quality of social connection has decreased
for young adults since 2006.</p>
<p>If social connection brings so many benefits, why do so many young
people still feel lonely? Part of the answer may lie in their
perceptions of others and their communities. Findings from new research
reveal that inaccurate social perceptions can be a barrier for social
connections. For instance, people tend to underestimate how fulfilled
and happy they will feel after interacting with strangers,61 having deep
conversations with friends,62 expressing gratitude,63 giving
compliments,64 and asking others for help.65</p>
<p><em>People are not very accurate in forecasting how they will feel
after engaging in social activities, leading them to miss out on
opportunities to connect.</em></p>
<p>In short, people are not very accurate in forecasting how they will
feel after engaging in social activities, leading them to miss out on
opportunities to connect.</p>
<p>We hypothesise that there may be other factors at play in addition to
inaccurate forecasting of future feelings. Perhaps people are not only
misjudging their own emotional outcomes but also holding inaccurate
beliefs about others and their communities. For example, students may
underestimate the empathy and care in others, and this empathy
perception gap might leave</p>
<p><img src="_page_147_Figure_7.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_148_Picture_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>individuals socially risk averse and ultimately more isolated.</p>
<p>We tested this hypothesis using data from the SCP.66 Drawing from two
years of data involving over 5,000 undergraduate students, we assessed
two types of data related to community empathy. First, we assessed
‘empathy perception’, where students estimated the empathy of their
peers. We also asked about their own levels of empathy. By combining
these two types of data, we can assess whether students’ perceptions
matched their peers’ self-report.</p>
<p>Our results indicate a persistent empathy perception gap. Students
tend to view other students as less empathic and caring than their peers
see themselves. For instance, participants estimated that 87% of
Stanford students would “act kindly</p>
<p>by helping others who are feeling bad”, whereas 96% of Stanford
students responded positively to the same question, indicating a 9%
empathy perception gap on this measure (Figure 5.10).</p>
<p>The consequences of this empathy perception gap were profound.
Students who perceived their peers as less empathic and supportive were
less likely to take social risks such as striking up conversations,
sharing personal struggles, or reaching out for help; behaviours that
are critical for building meaningful relationships. This social risk
avoidance led to missed opportunities to connect and learn from others,
perpetuating the misguided belief that those around them lack empathy
and care. Over time, this empathy perception created a vicious cycle of
misperception and social disconnection (Figure 5.11).</p>
<p><img src="_page_149_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<h2
id="campaigns-to-align-perceptions-can-foster-social-connection"><strong>Campaigns
to align perceptions can foster social connection</strong></h2>
<p>Empathy perception gaps help explain why young people are socially
isolated and lonely. They also illuminate a potential opportunity to
break the vicious cycle and promote social connection. When individuals
view the people and community that surround them as supportive and
caring, they are more likely to take the social risks of reaching out to
strangers and seeking social support. Taking these social risks can help
foster meaningful connections, expand social networks, and improve
wellbeing.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, we have pioneered a new intervention to
enhance social connection by addressing the perception gaps and
providing opportunities for students to learn about the care and support
in their community. We did this using two field experiments.</p>
<p>In the first field experiment, we presented students with data about
their peers’ high levels of empathy and interest in making friends. To
do this, we put up posters around residential halls with statistics like
“95% of Stanford students are likely to help others who are feeling
down” (Figure 5.12). We paired the posters with a one-hour
educational</p>
<p>workshop designed to reinforce the message that their peers were more
caring and supportive than they might think.</p>
<p>Students exposed to this data significantly shifted their
perceptions. On average, participants in the control condition
underestimated their peers’ empathy by 0.4 points (on a 7-point scale).
Participants in the experimental condition still underestimated their
peer’s empathy (by 0.1 points), but slightly less than participants in
the control condition, representing a 75% reduction. Students also
reported taking more social risks following our intervention – they
reached out to classmates they didn’t know, initiated conversations, and
were more willing to share their vulnerabilities. On average, the
frequency of these social risk behaviours increased by 11%.</p>
<p>In the second experiment, we expanded the intervention by adding
behavioural nudges delivered directly to students’ smartphones</p>
<p>(Figure 5.13). These nudges encouraged students to engage in small,
everyday acts of social risk-taking, such as complimenting a stranger or
catching up with someone they hadn’t spoken to in a while. Once again,
our intervention reduced the empathy perception gap. On average,
participants in the control condition underestimated their peers’
empathy by 1.0 points on a 7-point scale. Those in the experimental
condition also underestimated their peer’s empathy, but to a lesser
degree (0.9 points), representing a 10% reduction.</p>
<p>Similarly, our intervention also increased acts of social risk
behaviour. In the week following the intervention, experimental
condition participants were 89% more likely to report engaging in social
risk-taking compared to those in the control group. We also found that
these effects were long-lasting. Two months after the intervention,
students in the experimental group were still twice as likely to sign up
for a social event in</p>
<p><img src="_page_150_Figure_7.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_150_Figure_8.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_150_Figure_9.jpeg" /></p>
<p>which they have an extended conversation with strangers compared to
participants in the control group.</p>
<p>The intervention also strengthened students’ social networks. We
assessed students’ friendship networks four months after the
intervention and found that students in the experimental condition
reported an average of 0.44 more close friends compared to those in the
control group.</p>
<p>Together, results from these field experiments indicate that a
community’s empathy can be a powerful, yet underutilised, resource for
mental health and happiness. We provide initial evidence that
interventions highlighting a community’s care and empathy, as well as
behavioural nudges to encourage social risk-taking, can effectively
shift people’s perceptions and behaviours, as well as expand social
networks. These findings point to the importance of creating caring
social environments and helping individuals to recognise the empathy
that surrounds them.</p>
<h2 id="open-questions-and-future-directions"><strong>Open questions and
future directions</strong></h2>
<p>In previous sections, we described the robust relationships between
different aspects of social connection and overall happiness in young
adults. Next, we discuss some open questions and opportunities for
future exploration.</p>
<h3
id="towards-a-multifaceted-measure-of-social-connection"><strong>Towards
a multifaceted measure of social connection</strong></h3>
<p>Social connection is a multifaceted construct that encompasses the
quantity, quality, and structure of an individual’s social network.
Research so far has largely focused on the presence or absence of social
ties, with an emphasis on social isolation and loneliness. This
perspective overlooks the rich dimensions of social relationships. As
the World Health Organization defines health as “a state of complete
physical, mental, and social wellbeing, not merely the absence of
disease or infirmity”,67 social health is more than the absence of
social deficit, and thus encompasses the fulfilling, supportive, and
flourishing aspects of social connection.</p>
<p>A first step towards a more nuanced understanding of social
connection is the creation and utilisation of a common measure that (1)
encompasses different aspects of social connection, and (2) can be
applied to diverse cultural contexts. A standardised, multifaceted
measure of social connection can serve as a powerful tool to assess the
state of social health globally, and offer valuable new insights into
the intricate ways different aspects of social connection shape
wellbeing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, different factors of social connection could matter for
the wellbeing of people that vary by cultural background, age group, and
socio<em>Social connection is a multifaceted construct that encompasses
the quantity, quality, and structure of an individual’s social
network.</em></p>
<p>economic status. For example, existing research finds that the
quantity and quality of social interactions may be valued differently
depending on one’s age. Individuals in their 20s may prefer quantity
while those in their 30s may prefer quality.68 Thus, a multifaceted
measure of social connection assessing the global population can help
researchers identify which aspects of social connection most strongly
contribute to happiness across different groups.</p>
<p>An additional aspect that can be incorporated into existing measures
of social connection is relationship diversity: the variety of
relationship types within an individual’s social network. Recent
research has highlighted a robust correlation between happiness and
having a variety of relationships, such as family, close friends,
coworkers, and acquaintances.69 For example, a study of over 50,000
people reveals that interacting with a more diverse set of relationship
types predicts higher wellbeing. This effect, comparable with other
established contributors of wellbeing such as marital status, held after
controlling for total time spent socialising as well as the diversity of
activities that people engaged in.70</p>
<p>We are now seeing efforts to establish a global indicator of social
connection. In 2022, Gallup, Meta, and a group of academic advisors
collaborated on the State of Social Connections study, a
first-of-its-kind, in-depth look at people’s social connections around
the world. A second phase of the research, the State of Social
Connections Gallup World Poll survey, expanded its global reach by
running a select set of the State of Connections study questions on the
Gallup World Poll, reaching over 140 countries and providing the ability
to study overall life evaluations and the relative importance of the
quantity, quality, and diversity of social connection.71</p>
<h2
id="prevention-and-intervention-efforts-to-promote-social-connection"><strong>Prevention
and intervention efforts to promote social connection</strong></h2>
<p>The trends of declining social connection among young adults,
combined with the evidence on the associations between social connection
and wellbeing, point to an urgent need to take action. Social connection
generally occurs naturally among individuals and within communities.
However, when it does not, intervention becomes necessary to reduce
risk. We presented our own effort on intervention to enhance social
connection among Stanford University students. Yet, much remains to be
understood: which interventions work best, for whom, and under what
circumstances? Below, we discuss a few directions for future
research.</p>
<h4 id="technology-based-interventions"><em>Technology-based
interventions</em></h4>
<p>Today’s young adults are the first generation to have grown up
completely immersed in technologybased communications. Also called
‘digital natives’, young adults today have had access to the internet
and digital devices from a very young age. Researchers are starting to
learn more about the role of social networking and messaging apps in
social connection and loneliness.</p>
<p>With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and large
language models, research is needed to understand how best to use AI to
enhance social connection and wellbeing. Preliminary research shows that
AI-powered virtual companions — chatbots designed for conversation or
emotional support — may offer short-term relief from loneliness. These
tools simulate human interaction, providing immediate responses that
mimic companionship. While their potential is exciting, robust research
is essential to evaluate their long-term effectiveness and understand
how best to integrate them into broader efforts to promote
wellbeing.</p>
<h4 id="policy-based-interventions"><em>Policy-based
interventions</em></h4>
<p>Social relationships are shaped, in large part, by systemic societal,
economic, and technological factors. As such, there is growing interest
in the role of policy-based interventions in fostering social connection
and mitigating the growing trends in social isolation and loneliness.72
These</p>
<p><img src="_page_153_Picture_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>interventions aim to create structural changes that promote prosocial
behaviours and relationships at scale, moving beyond individual efforts
to address the broader contexts in which relationships emerge. An
example of such efforts is the introduction of social and emotional
learning (SEL) curriculum in schools. By embedding these practices into
educational systems, SEL programs create an environment where healthier
relationships can flourish, helping students develop critical tools for
connection.73</p>
<p>Policy-based interventions hold great potential for fostering social
connections. When we examine other public health challenges such as
smoking cessation, societal-level efforts such as taxation and public
health campaigns generally outperform individual-level approaches.74
Policy-based</p>
<p>interventions that address social isolation and loneliness are still
sparse, so future progress will require rigorous, evidence-based
research to carefully guide policy design and implementation.</p>
<p>Together, future work is needed to identify how interventions can
effectively promote social connection, particularly through the
promising avenues of technology and public policy. As we discussed
above, social connection is not a one-dimensional, catch-all concept. It
encompasses the quantity, quality, and the structure of social
relationships that individuals are embedded in. As such, we need
integrated, multi-level strategies that account for the interplay of
these factors.75</p>
<p>Equally important is understanding when these interventions may have
no effect or backfire. Well-intentioned efforts could inadvertently</p>
<p>deepen isolation or exacerbate disparities. Future interventions that
simultaneously address individual, community, and societal levels in a
systematic way are likely to be the most effective at promoting social
connection.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-1"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>This chapter has examined the critical role of social connection in
the happiness and wellbeing of young adults.</p>
<p>First, drawing from the Global Flourishing Study and the Gallup World
Poll, we showed that social disconnection is prevalent and growing in
young adults, and that both the quantity and quality of social
connection robustly map onto subjective wellbeing.</p>
<p>Second, we reviewed classic and contemporary studies that underscore
the importance of social relationships for human flourishing. Evidence
in this area points to a robust link between social connection and
wellbeing, both across individuals (happier people tend to report better
social connection) and within the same individuals over time (people
report greater happiness when more socially engaged). Building on these
correlational findings, there is growing evidence that credibly
demonstrates a significant causal effect of social connection on
improved mental health. Individuals who are randomly assigned with
social engagement tend to report lower stress when exposed to
distressing stimuli, regulate their emotions better, and report more
positive affect.</p>
<p>Third, we zoomed in on the Stanford Community Project; a large-scale,
longitudinal project that focuses on one undergraduate student
community. Data from this work have produced several discoveries that
advance the basic science of community wellbeing and provide avenues
through which to improve it: (1) friendships formed in the first few
weeks of college significantly shape the long-term mental health
trajectories of students; (2) both direct friendships and the broader
‘social microclimate’ can significantly contribute to wellbeing; (3) an
‘empathy perception gap’ — the tendency for young people to
underestimate the empathy of their peers —</p>
<p><em>Interventions that provide opportunities for students to learn
about the empathy and care in their community can effectively shift
empathy perceptions, encourage social risk-taking, and expand social
networks.</em></p>
<p>leads to missed opportunities for connection; and (4) interventions
that provide opportunities for students to learn about the empathy and
care in their community can effectively shift empathy perceptions,
encourage social risk-taking, and expand social networks. These findings
point to novel, promising ways of bolstering connection and happiness
among this age group.</p>
<p>In summary, this chapter highlights the multifaceted ways in which
social connection influences the wellbeing of young adults. Our evidence
points to practical opportunities to leverage social connection to
enhance happiness. By targeting both individual relationships and the
broader social environment, these strategies offer promising avenues for
improving the happiness and wellbeing of young adults.</p>

<h2 id="key-insights-4"><strong>Key Insights</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Increasing prosocial behaviour</strong> – donating,
volunteering, and helping strangers – <strong>is reliably connected to
decreasing deaths of despair around the world.</strong> Regression
results indicate that a ten percentagepoint increase in the share of
people engaging in prosocial behaviour is associated with approximately
one fewer death per year per 100,000. For a country like the United
Kingdom, with an adult population of approximately 55 million, that is
equivalent to about 550 preventable deaths per year.</p>
<p><strong>On average, deaths of despair decreased around the world by
nearly 5 deaths per 100,000 people over the period 2000–2019 in 59
middle- to high-income countries.</strong> This equates to approximately
2,750 people in a country like the UK. The largest declines occurred in
northeastern European countries, such as Lithuania and Latvia, which
tended to have very high initial levels.</p>
<p><strong>Deaths of despair declined in three quarters of the 59
considered countries, but are still high and rising in a few
cases,</strong> such as the United States and Republic of Korea.
Slovenia had the highest level in 2019, with more than 50 deaths of
despair per 100,000.</p>
<p><strong>Deaths of despair are nearly four times higher among men than
women, and more than double among those aged 60 and above compared to
15- to 29-year-olds.</strong> Three quarters of these deaths are due to
suicide, followed by deaths due to alcohol and drug abuse.</p>
<p>Investing in the conditions that support prosocial behaviour could
help create societies where people are more supportive, cooperative, and
trusting, and where deaths of despair are lower.</p>

abuse, and drug overdose. Together, they represent a form of ill-being
akin to extreme unhappiness. The term was introduced to describe
troubling trends in the United States,1 while little was known about
global patterns2. However, rising feelings of distress around the world
suggested this trend was not confined to the US.<sup>3</sup> Indeed, our
data show that Slovenia, not the US, had the highest rate of deaths of
despair in 2019, although the US did experience the greatest increase
over the period 2000 to 2019.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we document the levels of deaths of despair around
the world using the latest available data, show how these levels have
changed over time, and provide an initial analysis of the factors that
explain the rise or fall of deaths of despair within countries over
time. We focus particularly on prosocial behaviour – donating,
volunteering, and helping strangers – as a factor that could reduce
deaths of despair.</p>
<p>Previous research has documented the rise in premature mortality due
to suicides, opioid poisonings, and alcohol-related liver disease,
particularly in North America, Australia, and parts of Europe.4 The
increase in these deaths is typically linked to factors such as extreme
distress,5 feelings of hopelessness,6 social and economic
marginalisation,7 loss of social ties and decline in social capital,8
pharmaceutical marketing of prescription opioids9, rising occupational
injuries and pain,10 and stress stemming from perceived status loss,
especially among white populations.11 These deaths are more common among
disadvantaged groups, leading to inequalities in mortality based on
education,12 income,13 area-level deprivation,14 and economic
insecurity.15 In addition, evidence from studies on suicide and
wellbeing suggests that deaths of despair should be less prevalent in
countries where people engage more in prosocial behaviour.16</p>
<p>Our research shows that the previously documented trends in deaths of
despair do not extend around the world. In the United States, deaths of
despair rapidly rose for the reasons mentioned above, especially among
middle-aged men due to</p>

average from 2000 to 2019, due to declining suicide among older
men.</em></p>
<p>increased drug abuse. Whereas in our sample of 59 countries, deaths
of despair have declined on average from 2000 to 2019, due to declining
suicide among older men. In any case, preventable deaths are concerning
and it should be possible to reduce them further. Our regression results
indicate that fostering prosocial behaviour should reduce deaths of
despair.</p>
<h2 id="deaths-of-despair-in-59-countries"><strong>Deaths of despair in
59 countries</strong></h2>
<p>Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the average number of deaths of
despair per year, in our sample of 59 countries, was 23 per 100,000
persons aged 15 and above.17 In a country like the United Kingdom, this
equates to approximately 12,500 preventable deaths each year.18 Grenada
had the fewest deaths of despair with 4 per 100,000, while Slovenia had
the greatest at 53 per 100,000.19</p>
<p>Figure 6.1 shows the ranking of deaths of despair in 2019,20 grouped
by region and broken down into their three components. The highest rates
are recorded in Slovenia, followed by Guyana, the United States, and
Lithuania. Grenada, and Antigua and Barbuda have the lowest rates. Most
Northern European countries (such as Finland) and Central and Eastern
European countries (such as Slovenia and Lithuania) have scores above
average. The fact that Nordic countries top the European ranking of
deaths of despair, as well as the global ranking of subjective wellbeing
(see Chapter 2), poses a puzzle that we will discuss later. In the
United States, Canada, and Australia, deaths of despair are also above
average, comparable to Central and Eastern European countries. Among the
six Asian countries in our sample, the Republic of Korea and Kazakhstan
stand out as the two cases with the highest</p>
<p><img src="_page_164_Figure_3.jpeg" /></p>
<p>scores, mainly due to high levels of suicides. Mediterranean and
Latin American countries are well below the international average.</p>
<p>Our measure of deaths of despair includes deaths due to alcohol use
disorder, drug use disorder, self-inflicted injuries, and ill-defined
injuries/ accidents from the WHO Mortality Database.21 Self-inflicted
and ill-defined injuries/accidents (of undetermined intent) are summed
to obtain suicides, consistent with previous research22 because
ill-defined deaths could include suicide. Previous studies used
different variants of deaths of despair, including slightly different
causes of mortality depending on data source. Online Appendix A provides
more details on how we define and operationalise deaths of despair.</p>
<p>While we used the best available data, caution should be exercised
when interpreting differences in deaths across countries. Cultural and
institutional differences can affect ‘cause of death’ reporting and
limit the comparability of data. For more details on the quality of data
and issues with the comparability of cause of death across countries
please see Box 6.1.</p>
<p>Our sample is limited to 59 countries because many countries,
especially low-income countries, do not provide the necessary data to
meet the standards for international comparison.23 We focus on the
period 2000 to 2019 because it gives us the longest and broadest sample
of countries possible. Fewer countries have data before 2000 and after
2019. We present mortality figures for populations aged 15 and older in
order to match the surveyed populations used to obtain prosocial
behaviour figures. Tables B1 to B3 in the online appendix provide sample
details, listing the included countries and the reasons for excluding
others.</p>
<h4
id="box-6.1-who-mortality-database-and-deaths-of-despair-data-quality"><strong>Box
6.1: WHO mortality database and deaths of despair data
quality</strong></h4>
<p>There are a few reasons why cross-country comparisons of deaths of
despair pose an issue. These reasons include systematic differences in
the process of assigning cause of death, the capacity for obtaining and
storing such information, as well as legal or societal differences.</p>
<p>National statistics on mortality by cause are sourced from the WHO
Mortality Database which collects and harmonises information from
country civil registration and vital statistics systems. When a death
occurs, it is registered at the local civil registry with information on
the cause of death, which is typically filed by health professionals
such as doctors or nurses. Health professionals document the injuries or
diseases that led to the death of the person and list what they believe
is the “underlying cause of death” on the death certificate. In some
cases, the death registration process may be different, such as suicides
and sudden</p>
<p>deaths, when it is a coroner who determines and reports the cause of
death. Subsequently, the cause of death is assigned an International
Classification of Diseases (ICD) death code, registered in the national
databases, and sent to the WHO by each country. National statistics
offices, or the ministry of health or registrargeneral’s office, are
responsible for compiling the cause of death data for submission to WHO
every year.</p>
<p>The WHO Mortality Database does not include death statistics for all
countries. Some do not report their mortality data to the WHO and some
send data that are not in standard ICD or do not have ICD codes at all.
In other countries, such as China and India, the total deaths reported
to the WHO represent less than 5% of the population of the country,
hence their data is deemed unreliable and not made available on the WHO
Mortality Database. In many countries, cause of death</p>
<p>information is difficult to obtain because the system for recording
such information is not functioning or non-existent. In addition, there
may be a lack of medical certifiers to complete the death
certificates.24 As a result, many deaths may go uncounted or be recorded
without listing a cause. When the WHO receives countries’ data, they
assess their completeness and quality. They display the data on the
portal if they are estimated to include at least 65% of all deaths
occurring in a country, with the appropriate cause of death
recorded.</p>
<p>The large variations in the systems and processes to define mortality
causes imply there may be very different numbers of deaths that are
registered with a specific cause. This creates a problem for
cross-country comparisons of mortality by cause in general, and even
more so for deaths of despair, and suicides in particular.</p>
<p>The person responsible for writing the cause of death on the death
certificate may be different across countries. In some countries, the
police are responsible, while in others a medical doctor, coroner, or
judicial investigator takes on this role. Differences in doctors’
training, access to medical records, and autopsy requirements contribute
to these discrepancies. The legal or judicial systems that decide causes
of death also vary. For instance, in some countries suicide is illegal
and is not listed as a classifiable cause of death, leading to
underreporting or misclassification of suicides as accidents, violence,
or deaths of “undetermined intent.”25</p>
<p>Data on suicides, even when reported, can be inaccurate due to social
factors as well. In some countries, suicide might be taboo and highly
stigmatised, so the families and friends of the person who committed
suicide might decide to misreport or not disclose the mortality cause,
causing underreporting of its incidence. In other societies, such as
Northern Europe, there is less stigma attached to suicides, and alcohol
and drug use.</p>
<p>Lastly, another layer of complexity with cross-country comparisons of
deaths of despair is given by the differences in the ICD codes used to
categorise deaths, as countries may adopt different versions at
different times, complicating data harmonisation and comparison.</p>
<p>Although the WHO Mortality Database provides ICD-codes harmonised
data per country, cross-country comparisons are still discouraged. As a
result, we analyse variations of deaths of despair over time
<em>within</em> countries, rather than focusing on cross-country
comparisons.</p>

Income groups are defined based on 2005 values of GNI per capita in US
dollars and World Bank (2024a).</p>
<p>On average, nearly 75% of deaths of despair are due to suicides
(16.40 per 100,000), followed by alcohol abuse (4.33 per 100,000) and
drug overdose (2.27 per 100,000) (see Table 6.1). Total deaths of
despair represent 2.2% of all deaths – 23 out of 1,045 deaths per
100,00, per year, on average.26</p>
<p>Table 6.1 also shows that deaths of despair are fairly equally
distributed across lower-middle (22.95), upper-middle (22.55), and
high-income countries (23.37), with no accurate data available for
low-income countries (and sufficient time coverage). It is worth
emphasising that figures</p>
<p>on deaths of despair in China and India are missing.</p>
<p>In Table 6.2, we break down the data by age and gender. Deaths of
despair are nearly four times higher among men than among women. In the
case of alcohol abuse, it is five times higher. Deaths of despair,
independently from their cause, are more than double among men and women
aged 60+ (30.45) compared to those aged 15 to 29 (13.45). However,
mortality due to drug overdose is more frequent among working-age
adults. The average mortality rate is 3.15 among people aged 30 to 59,
and 1.47 among others.</p>

<p>Note: Deaths are per 100,000 for the population aged 15 and
above.</p>
<p>Since the year 2000, the number of deaths of despair has declined in
nearly 75% of the considered countries (see Figure 6.2). The decline
approaches -2 deaths per 100,000 persons per year in Lithuania, Latvia,
and Estonia, followed by Kazakhstan, Finland, Switzerland,
Luxembourg,</p>
<p>and Denmark. The United States, on the other hand, has seen an
average yearly increase of 1.3 deaths per 100,000. Hence, as previously
documented, the United States is characterised by both high and
increasing levels of deaths of despair. The Republic of Korea and
Slovakia have the second and third highest yearly increase in deaths of
despair, with average annual increases below 1. Among Western European
countries, the yearly growth rates in the Netherlands, Portugal, Greece
and the United Kingdom are positive, but very close to zero.</p>
<p>Table 6.3 indicates that the yearly decline of deaths of despair was
-0.41 deaths per 100,000 in upper-middle-income countries, -0.28 in
lower-middle-income countries, and nearly zero (-0.09) in high-income
countries where only suicides declined, whereas both drug and alcohol
abuse increased. These changes are driven largely by a general decline
in suicide (-0.28), whereas drug overdoses are on the rise in all
countries (0.05), especially among high-income countries (0.09). Hence,
although the levels of deaths of despair appear unrelated to a country’s
income (Table 6.1), the yearly changes indicate that deaths of despair
are more concerning in highincome countries.</p>
<p>Countries that had initially high levels of deaths of despair also
tended to have large decreases over time. Among the 15 countries with
the highest levels (Figure 6.1), nine experienced decreases (Figure
6.2), and at rates that were among the highest, e.g., the Baltic
nations: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. To assess whether this
observation is statistically meaningful, we performed convergence tests
of whether the initial level of deaths of despair influences its
subsequent growth.<sup>27</sup></p>
<p>Table 6.4 indicates that higher initial levels of deaths of despair
generally correspond to negative changes over time (-0.025, significant
at 1%). In other words, deaths of despair decreased more in countries
where the incidence of deaths of despair was higher. This result is
remarkably stable, both in magnitude and significance, for men and women
and for people in various age groups. Investigating the causes of this
relationship is beyond the scope of this analysis. However, it is
possible that this</p>

<p>happened because societies experiencing high mortality rates adopted
formal and/or informal strategies to prevent deaths of despair.</p>
<p>More generally, deaths of despair declined among both men and women
independently of their age (see Table B4 in the online appendix). This
was mainly due to decreasing suicides across age groups. Mortality due
to alcohol abuse did not change much on average – it diminished among
the working-age population but increased for those aged 60+. Among the
three causes of mortality composing deaths of despair, only drug abuse
shows positive growth rates on average (0.05). This trend concerns</p>
<p>both men and women, especially in the age group 30 to 59.</p>
<p>Three notable patterns emerged among the countries that experienced
increasing deaths of despair. The majority witnessed increasing deaths
among older men due to alcohol abuse. In the US, Canada, and the UK,
deaths of despair increased among men aged 30 to 59 primarily due to
rising drug abuse. In the Republic of Korea, deaths of despair increased
largely among men aged 60+ due to increasing suicide. These distinct
patterns indicate that the mechanisms behind the rise in deaths of
despair in the United States do not apply generally.</p>

<p>In sum, the available evidence from 59 countries around the world
shows that deaths of despair have declined since 2000 in nearly 75% of
countries. Countries like Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have seen the
largest decreases, while deaths of despair increased in the United
States, Republic of Korea, and Slovakia. Suicides are the most prevalent
cause of despair-related mortality. On average, deaths of despair are
nearly four times more prevalent among men than women and twice as
prevalent among those aged 60+ compared to 15- to 29-year-olds. The
only</p>
<p>exception is drug overdose, which is more frequent for men and women
of working age than for others.</p>
<p>The level of deaths of despair appears unrelated to the income level
of a country. However, this is not the case for the changes over time.
On average, deaths of despair declined faster in poorer countries than
in rich ones. The number of suicides declined at a rate that more than
offset the increases in drug- and alcohol-related deaths in lower-middle
and upper-middle-income countries, but the suicide decline is lower
in</p>
<p>high-income countries. In the latter case, the average annual
decrease of 0.19 deaths per 100,000 persons was almost offset by the
increase in drug- and alcohol-related deaths.</p>
<p>Why do deaths of despair rise in some countries and fall in others?
Differences in how prosocial behaviour evolved in different countries
may offer an explanation. In the next section, we describe the reasons
why prosocial behaviour could contribute to less deaths of despair.</p>
<h2 id="the-case-for-prosocial-behaviour"><strong>The case for prosocial
behaviour</strong></h2>
<p>Prosocial behaviour – sometimes called acts of kindness or altruism –
includes behaviours that are done for the benefit of others. It is a
behavioural measure of social capital which includes trust, behaviours,
norms and shared values enabling a society to cooperate to achieve
common goals. For both prosocial behaviour and social capital, there are
numerous studies from multiple disciplines that document their
beneficial impacts on individuals and society.</p>
<p>Prosocial behaviour should contribute to limiting deaths of despair
for numerous reasons. People who engage in prosocial behaviour are
healthier28 and happier,29 and they experience a greater sense of
purpose and meaning in life30 as well as improved psychological
flourishing.31 Each of these aspects should reduce the risk of deaths of
despair. Prosocial behaviour also strengthens and expands individuals’
social networks, thereby increasing access to social support and
information, which improves coping strategies that mitigate stress
perception and physiological responses.32 Importantly, prosocial
behaviour may reduce deaths of despair by buffering individuals against
the harmful effects of stressors and life challenges. In times of
uncertainty and distress, these social networks provide practical
assistance, emotional support, and advice which boost wellbeing33 and
reduce the likelihood of resorting to maladaptive coping mechanisms,
such as substance abuse.34 Finally, prosocial behaviour fosters
self-esteem, which serves as a protective factor against life
challenges.35</p>
<p><em>Social relationships foster emotional support, provide a sense of
belonging, and promote meaning, self-esteem and purpose in life which,
in turn, support mental wellbeing and reduce the likelihood of engaging
in harmful behaviours.</em></p>
<p>The benefits of prosocial behaviour extend beyond the direct effects
on those engaging in them. Prosocial behaviour contributes to social
capital by fostering trust in others, shared values and sense of
responsibility, and cooperative norms both within civic networks and
across diverse groups.36 See Chapter 2 for additional details.</p>
<p>Social capital, more broadly, also affects health and wellbeing
outcomes directly and indirectly, both through individual-level
psychosocial mechanisms (e.g., emotional support, stress buffering, and
behaviour modulation)37 and community-level social cohesion (e.g.,
collective efficacy and social norms).</p>
<p>Social capital can directly affect individual health and wellbeing
via cognitive, emotional, behavioural, and biological pathways.38
Indeed, social relationships foster emotional support, provide a sense
of belonging, and promote meaning, self-esteem and purpose in life39
which, in turn, support mental wellbeing and reduce the likelihood of
engaging in harmful behaviours.40 In fact, the influence of social
capital extends beyond individual psychosocial support as it reinforces
positive community outcomes. Social norms within communities affect
behavioural mechanisms by fostering accountability, encouraging
health-promoting habits, and discouraging risky or harmful behaviours
and the adoption of maladaptive coping mechanisms, such as substance
abuse, and excessive alcohol consumption.41 For example, previous
research demonstrated that individuals embedded in strong social
networks are more likely to seek help for mental health issues, which,
in turn, lowers the chances of harmful behaviour.42</p>
<p>At the community level, social capital fosters life expectancy,
longevity, and public health, and reduces all-cause mortality.43
Community social capital is linked to lower death rates, including from
heart disease,44 and to lower mortality from cancer, cardiovascular
disease, and suicide.45 Furthermore, collective efficacy, i.e.,
perception of mutual trust and willingness to help each other, has been
associated with positive societal outcomes including reduced rates of
assaults, homicide, premature mortality, and asthma.46</p>
<h4 id="changes-in-prosocial-behaviour"><strong>Changes in prosocial

<p>In 2019, on average, 31.1% of respondents engaged in prosocial
behaviour, with 45.3% stating that</p>
<p>they helped a stranger, 29.9% donated money, and 18.2% volunteered in
groups or associations (see Table 6.5). These data are sourced from the
Gallup World Poll (GWP) and refer to the population aged 15 and over.
Our measure of prosocial behaviour is the average of the shares of
respondents answering “yes” to each of the three components: donating
money, volunteering, and helping strangers.47 Our sample includes 50
countries and covers the period 2005–06 to 2019 when data on prosocial
behaviour and deaths of despair are available. See Tables B1–B3 in the
online appendix for details.</p>
<p>Prosocial behaviour is more frequent in highincome countries where

<p><img src="_page_174_Picture_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>reported that they engaged in prosocial behaviour, mainly helping
others (45.6%) or donating money (39.4%). Helping others is the main
form of prosocial behaviour in lower-middleincome countries where more
than 50% reported helping others.</p>
<p>Over the period 2005–6 to 2019, engagement in prosocial behaviour
decreased in most countries. We exclude the years after 2019, which are
marked by rising prosocial behaviours (see Chapter 2) due to the limited
availability of mortality data and because the pandemic might</p>
<p>have affected prosocial behaviours and deaths of despair in
exceptional ways. Figure 6.3 presents the average yearly changes in
prosocial behaviour by country and world region. Most changes are below
1 percentage point per year in absolute value. The countries where
prosocial behaviour decreased at a faster rate are Czechia, Switzerland,
Belgium, and Japan. Prosocial behaviour decreased in most Western
European countries, in some Latin American countries, in Japan, the
Philippines, and the Republic of Korea, as well as in North America and
Australia.</p>
<p><img src="_page_175_Figure_2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>The average change is -0.23 percentage points per year (see Table
6.6). However, the decrease was steeper in high-income countries, where
engagement decreased by -0.45 percentage points per year, compared to
upper-middleincome countries, where the rate of decrease was -0.14. In
both cases, the decrease was prevalently associated with a decrease in
donating money which, in high-income countries, proceeded at a rate of
-0.99%, followed by decreasing engagement in volunteering activities and
helping others. This general decrease in prosocial behaviour is
consistent with findings from earlier studies that documented a
long-term decrease of social capital, prevalently in industrialised
countries.48</p>
<p>Prosocial behaviour increased by 0.13 percentage points per year in
lower-middle-income countries. However, this increase masks two
contrasting trends: on one hand, an increase in the share of people
helping others (0.56); on the other hand, a decrease in volunteering
(-0.15).</p>
<p>The decrease in prosocial behaviour is about two times larger for
women than for men, but this difference occurs to varying degrees across
age groups and behaviours (see Table B5 in the online appendix). The
most striking gender difference concerns people helping others. The
modest increase in the share of people helping others (0.05) is driven
entirely by men. Among women, helping others declined slightly on
average, especially among women aged 60+.</p>

<p>In sum, engagement in prosocial behaviour decreased in 30 out of 50
countries over the period 2005–06 to 2019. This decrease was observed
for both men and women of all ages and is the result of a general
decrease in donations and volunteering, especially among upper-middle
and high-income countries. Do these changes help us understand how
deaths of despair have changed over time? In particular, does prosocial
behaviour buffer against despair leading to death?</p>
<p>Evidence from three countries (the United States, Republic of Korea,
and Finland) provides a starting point to address these questions.</p>
<p>The US and Korea stand out for their high and rapidly increasing
deaths of despair, while Finland is notable for high but decreasing
deaths of despair. Indeed, the pace of increasing deaths of despair in
the US and Korea is approximately the opposite of the decrease in
Finland (see Figure 6.2). One potential explanation for this contrast is
differing prosocial behaviour trends. In both the US and Korea,
prosocial behaviour declined over time, whereas in Finland, it increased
(see Figure 6.3). This pattern strengthens the hypothesis that prosocial
behaviour plays a role in reducing deaths of despair, which is the
subject of the next section.</p>
<h2
id="explaining-deaths-of-despair-over-time-the-role-of-prosocial-behaviour"><strong>Explaining
deaths of despair over time: the role of prosocial
behaviour</strong></h2>
<p>In our sample of 50 countries, regression analysis confirms that
increasing prosocial behaviour correlates with decreasing deaths of
despair over time. Donations are the most important component of
prosocial behaviour and they have a larger and more precisely estimated
impact on men compared to women, and on older compared to younger
people. The regression analysis allows us to account for a host of
relevant control variables as alternative explanations, such as
religiosity and poverty. Prosocial behaviour maintains a similar
relationship in all instances.</p>
<h4 id="estimation-technique-and-control-variables"><strong>Estimation
technique and control variables</strong></h4>
<p>We estimate the relationship between prosocial behaviour and deaths
of despair using a standard regression framework which simultaneously
considers the influence of multiple variables including prosocial
behaviour. This approach allows us to isolate the relationship between
prosocial behaviour and deaths of despair from the influence of multiple
explanatory factors. For instance, deaths of despair could be influenced
by economic, demographic, governmental, and societal characteristics. To
this end, we consider as many variables as possible that might confound
the relationship. We begin with the full set of variables with adequate
data and then reduce the set using a standard variable selection
technique.49</p>
<p>We considered the following economic factors: GDP per capita, GDP per
capita growth rate, inflation rate, unemployment rate, and labour force
participation rate (separately defined by gender). During periods of
recessions, with declining purchasing power and rising unemployment,
people experience more financial pressure and suicides tend to rise.
According to Galbraith (2009), during the early years of the Great
Depression (1929-1932), suicides increased from 17.0 to 21.3 per 100,000
in the United States. The labour force participation rate is the
population share that is either working or seeking work. Decreases for
men correspond, in part, with people giving up on seeking work due to
factors such as bad health,50 discouragement, and desperation.</p>
<p>We included the population age structure, measured using population
shares for ages 30–44, 45–59, 60–64, and 65+51; the female population
share; divorce rate; and degree of urbanisation. The population
structure accounts for the varying age and gender compositions of
countries and the varying degrees to which they engage in prosocial
behaviour or die from deaths of despair. For instance, we observe that
those aged 60–64 are much more likely to engage in prosocial behaviour,
especially donating, than those aged 65+, which is why we distinguish
them in the analysis.52 The female population share, divorce rate, and
degree of urbanisation are included as deaths of despair are greater
among men (see Table 6.2), in communities with greater divorce rates,53
and in rural areas.54</p>
<p>We also considered religious importance, quality of governance,
health expenditures, and the three variables from the <em>World
Happiness Report</em> that are used to explain differences in life
evaluations around the world, specifically: support, freedom, and
perceptions of corruption. Religiosity is an important control variable
because, in many cases, religions forbid suicides and discourage the use
of drugs. Religiosity is also often associated with volunteering,
donating money, and a high propensity to help strangers. Quality of
governance could affect the resources available and opportunities for
societal improvement. Religiosity and quality of governance have also
previously been found to be associated with suicide.55 Health
expenditures capture the quality of health care available to
individuals. Feelings of support, having someone to count on, should
alleviate feelings of despair; freedom could help one climb out of a bad
place. Likewise, a lack of freedom corresponds to a lack of agency and
despair. Perceived corruption operates somewhat similarly to freedom and
the opposite of quality of governance. If the system is perceived to be
corrupt, then individuals may believe they have less ability to affect
their community and own lives.</p>
<p>Lastly, we included indicator variables for each country and year,
so-called country and year fixed effects. Country fixed effects account
for all fixed characteristics of a country including, for</p>
<p>instance, latitude, which is predictive of climate and suicide56.
When including country fixed effects, the estimated relations correspond
to changes within countries over time, not differences across countries.
Year fixed effects account for any common trends over time that exist
across countries. See Online Appendix C for a list of data sources.</p>
<h2
id="increasing-prosocial-behaviour-is-associated-with-decreasing-deaths-of-despair"><strong>Increasing
prosocial behaviour is associated with decreasing deaths of
despair</strong></h2>
<p>The results of rigorous analyses – in which we isolate the relation
between changing prosocial behaviour and deaths of despair from fixed
country characteristics and the contemporaneous effects of numerous
control variables – make us confident that prosocial behaviour does
indeed contribute to decreasing deaths of despair. Our results are
presented in Table 6.7.57 The negative coefficient means that when
prosocial behaviour increases within a country by one percentage point,
we can expect a decrease in deaths of despair in the same country by
0.096 deaths per 100,000. In the case of the United States, with a
population aged 15+ of nearly 270 million, this amounts to about 260
persons for each percentage point.</p>
<p>Columns 2 to 4 refine the analysis by checking how each of the three
prosocial behaviour components explains deaths of despair. Donating
money, volunteering, and helping a stranger are all associated with
lower levels of deaths of despair, but only donating money is
statistically different from zero. This could be because donating money
is the only component of prosocial behaviour that contributes to
decreasing deaths of despair, or because the data do not provide enough
statistical power to identify significant effects for all three
variables. Either way, considering the beneficial role played by
prosocial behaviour in general, and by donating money in particular,
decreasing engagement observed in many high-income countries until 2019
is a cause of concern.</p>
<p>The variable selection process, discussed in footnote 48, reduced our
set of explanatory variables (including prosocial behaviour) from the 20
discussed above to the 7 (excluding</p>
<p>fixed effects) presented in Table 6.7. Perhaps surprisingly,
variables such as religiosity, GDP, and unemployment were not among the
most important variables. This may be because country fixed effects
account for all country characteristics that do not change over time,
and even some factors that do not vary much or frequently. Thus, the
impact of religiosity on deaths of despair is accounted for in our
model, to the extent that religiosity remains stable. GDP and
unemployment vary over time more than religiosity but also vary along
with the other variables, especially the economic ones that were
retained, i.e., inflation and labour force participation. The remaining
variables, together with the fixed effects, account for the influences
of those that were dropped.58 In any case, the analysis is not intended
to uncover the causal impacts of the control variables (e.g., inflation
and support) and, for this reason, we do not recommend interpreting them
causally.</p>
<p>In addition to the 20 previously mentioned variables, we tested five
more variables that were left out of the previous analysis because they
have reduced data coverage, specifically: the poverty rate, income
inequality, public social expenditures, population share living alone,
and the population share with at least secondary education (separately
by gender). The poverty rate – measured as the population share that
earns less than $3.65 a day (adjusted for purchasing power) – is the
population share considered to earn too little to meet basic material
needs in lower-middle-income countries. Income inequality – measured
using the Gini coefficient – is often connected with a sense of
unfairness and distrust, which in turn reduces one’s sense of control
over their life. Public social expenditures represent the social safety
net, e.g., expenditures on health, unemployment benefits, and child and
elderly care. The population share living alone reflects one form of
social isolation, which could be related to loneliness and despair (see
Chapter 4). The population share with at least upper-secondary education
could be important as deaths of despair tend to be greater among less
educated groups in the United States.59 Tables B7 and B8 in the online
appendix show respectively the results of regressions with the full set
of control</p>

<p>variables and with the additional five ones just described. Across
nearly all of the regressions, prosocial behaviour maintains a
statistically significant and negative relation with a broadly similar
magnitude.</p>
<p>Additional analysis reveals differences between the average
relationship for the full population and for population subgroups.
Columns 1–5 in Table 6.8 summarise the results of the same model
presented in column 1 of Table 6.7 but this time for men and women of
various age groups. As in the previous results, greater prosocial
behaviour is associated with fewer deaths of despair, but the relation
is only statistically significant for men in later stages of life. In
these cases, the coefficient magnitudes are larger than for the full
population. For instance, increasing prosocial behaviour by 1 percentage
point would reduce deaths of despair among people aged 60+ by 0.21
people per 100,000 (compared with 0.096 for the full population); and
the relation for men is more than three times larger than for women. We
also replicate the analysis using donations, from column 2 of Table 6.7.
The results, presented in columns 6–10 of Table 6.8, indicate donations
are likewise negatively related to deaths of despair, and statistically
significant for both men and women in older ages.</p>
<h4 id="social-capital-and-deaths-of-despair"><strong>Social capital and
deaths of despair</strong></h4>
<p>In this section, we complement the previous analysis using social
trust and group membership.60 These are two widely used measures of
social capital and we expect that their increase should be associated
with lower deaths of despair within countries for the reasons discussed
earlier.61 Stated briefly, societies with higher trust in others or more
participation in groups and associations should be more cohesive than
others and therefore better equipped to look after those who fall
behind. Group membership also provides a sense of belonging and
community to those who participate in it, and in many cases, a service
to the broader society.</p>
<p>Trust and group membership data come from the integrated World Values
Survey and European Values Study dataset, which allows us to consider a
longer time period. We include all the countries</p>
<p>with at least three waves of observations between waves 2 and 7
(1991–2019) and the necessary mortality data. Table B6 in the online
appendix provides summary statistics.</p>
<p>We use the same analytical technique as the previous section and the
same reduced set of control variables as presented in Table 6.7.
However, we exclude the controls sourced from the Gallup World Poll
(social support and perceptions of corruption) which are unavailable
before 2005.</p>
<p>The results are broadly consistent with the previous ones. Both trust
and membership are negatively related to deaths of despair, although the
coefficients are not statistically different from zero (see Tables 6.9
and 6.10). This could be because there are fewer observations and
countries, which reduces estimation precision. Indeed, the estimates are
fairly similar across social capital measures. An increase in prosocial
behaviour is associated with 0.096 fewer deaths per 100,000 (Table 6.7),
while increases in trust and membership are associated with 0.095 (Table
6.9) and 0.074 (Table 6.10) fewer deaths per 100,000.</p>
<p>While no statistically significant relationships are observed in the
full population, distinct patterns emerge within specific gender and age
groups. For social trust, the magnitudes are larger for men compared to
women and for the uppermiddle-aged compared to other age groups. Indeed,
for upper-middle-aged individuals, increasing social trust is
significantly associated with a decrease in deaths of despair for both
men and women. An increase in membership correlates with fewer deaths of
despair in the full sample of women on average. For men, an increase in
membership is significantly linked to a reduction in deaths of despair
within the youngest age group.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-deaths-of-despair-relate-to-unhappiness"><strong>How do
deaths of despair relate to (un)happiness?</strong></h2>
<p>Although Northern European countries typically top the rankings in
life evaluations, many of them (e.g., Finland) also experience
relatively high rates of deaths of despair (see Figure 6.1). This
seeming contradiction has been referred to as a puzzle in the past62 and
requires an explanation. In this section, we find that such countries
are exceptions and we discuss the differences between deaths of despair
and life evaluations that could give rise to these exceptional
cases.</p>
<p>Figure 6.4 presents the relationship between annual, within-country
changes in life evaluations and deaths of despair over time. The trend
line illustrates increasing life evaluations are associated with
decreasing deaths of despair. Generally, high life evaluations do
<em>not</em> go with high deaths of despair. At the same time, the
dispersion in dots indicates that the variables are not simply the
opposite of each other. In fact, changing life evaluations explain less
than 10% of changing deaths of despair. This inexact match is what
empirically allows for countries like Finland to be high on both.</p>

<p>Although conceptually related, deaths of despair are distinct from
life evaluations. Deaths of despair, as suggested by the name, result
from negative feelings of despair, whereas life evaluations represent a
cognitive evaluation of how one feels about their life. Negative
feelings and cognitive evaluations correlate but are not simply the
opposite of each other.63 Furthermore, despair is more forward-looking
than current negative feelings. Consequently, it is even less related to
life evaluations conceptually than many other negative feelings.</p>
<p>We use the same technique presented in the previous section to
analyse the empirical relation between deaths of despair and life
evaluations. The presence of distinct patterns in their associations
with our explanatory variables will help us pinpoint where deaths of
despair and life evaluations differ. For this purpose, we expand the
list of explanatory variables from the model presented in Table 6.7 by
adding back GDP per capita and satisfaction with freedom, which were
dropped in our variable selection process for deaths of despair, but are
important in the</p>
<p><img src="_page_185_Figure_3.jpeg" /></p>
<p><em>World Happiness Report</em> for life evaluations. We first assess
prosocial behaviour as an explanatory variable and then one of its
components, donations, because the <em>World Happiness Report</em>
typically explains life evaluations using, among others, donations
(labelled as generosity).</p>
<p>To allow comparison across variables, we report the results in Table
6.11 using standardised variables, each adjusted to a common scale in
line with standard practice. This is why the coefficient of prosocial
behaviour in the first column of Table 6.11 is different from the
coefficient in</p>
<p>Table 6.7. The two coefficients are from the same model, except that
the one in Table 6.11 comes from a standardised variable. Table 6.11
shows that, in standardised terms, donations have equivalent relations
with both deaths of despair and life evaluations.64</p>
<p>The first thing to note is that the variables explain life
evaluations better than deaths of despair. The R-squared, a measure of
how well the model fits the data, is 0.40 for the Cantril Ladder and
0.29 for deaths of despair (see the bottom of columns 1 and 2).</p>

<p>The results also reveal deaths of despair are more sensitive to
prosocial behaviour and the population structure, especially the
population share aged 65+. Life evaluations are more sensitive to GDP
per capita, freedom, and social support. In common, they have the male
labour force participation rate (although of somewhat different
magnitudes) and perceptions of corruption. The inflation rate and
population share aged 60–64 are not statistically significant for either
outcome.</p>
<p>In sum, while it is possible for countries to have high deaths of
despair and high life evaluations, these are exceptions. Conceptually,
deaths of despair are related to life evaluations, but also quite
distinct. The former is a behaviour connected to hopelessness, while
life evaluations are cognitive evaluations of one’s current life as a
whole. Empirically, their determinants are similar but not the same. In
any case, increasing prosocial behaviours, specifically donations,
improves both outcomes, reducing deaths of despair and increasing life
evaluations.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-2"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Deaths of despair – due to suicide, alcohol abuse, and drug overdose
– generally declined from 2000 to 2019 in our sample of 59 countries,
based on data from the World Health Organization. However, the number is
still high and has risen in some cases, notably in the United States and
Republic of Korea. On average, 23 per 100,000 people died from deaths of
despair in 2019. One factor that can contribute to reducing deaths of
despair is prosocial behaviour. Our analysis indicates that a ten
percentage-point increase in the share of people engaging in prosocial
behaviour is associated with approximately 1 fewer death per 100,000
people per year. For a country like the United Kingdom, which has a
15-and-older</p>
<p>population of approximately 55 million, that is equivalent to about
550 people per year.65</p>
<p>Deaths of despair are not equally distributed across and within
countries. In our sample, deaths in 2019 were fewest in Grenada and
greatest in Slovenia. However, differences in cultural and institutional
characteristics call for caution when comparing deaths of despair across
countries. Within countries, deaths of despair were nearly four times
higher among men than women; more than double among those aged 60+
compared to 15- to 29-year-olds; and were primarily due to suicide,
which accounted for three out of every four deaths.</p>
<p>Prosocial behaviour generally decreased between 2006 and 2019.
According to Gallup World Poll data, volunteering and donating money
decreased, especially in high-income countries. Only the share of people
helping others showed signs of growth, but this was limited to
lower-middle-income countries. The general decrease in prosocial
behaviours concerned men and women of all age groups in a similar
manner. However, as shown in Chapter 2, there are signs of increasing
prosocial behaviours since 2019, after the period of our analysis. Since
data on deaths of despair end in 2019, we do not know whether these
increases are associated with declining deaths of despair.</p>
<p>We extended the regression analysis to two other common measures of
social capital: social trust and group participation. Sourced from the
integrated European Values Study and World Values Survey dataset, these
variables are available for a longer period of time, but for a smaller
sample of countries compared to our analysis of prosocial behaviours.
Results indicate similar negative within-country correlations between
the two measures of social capital and deaths of despair but, in
general, they were not statistically significant.</p>
<p>There are two aspects of our analysis worth emphasising. The first is
that the technique we used evaluates the association between variables
by matching their within-country changes over time. This limits concerns
of international comparability which are a major problem in the analysis
of mortality by cause. The second aspect is that the negative
relationship between prosocial behaviour and deaths of despair holds</p>
<p>after considering the contemporaneous changes of other variables,
such as economic growth, unemployment rate, labour force participation,
religiosity, and the share of elderly people, among others. This
evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that prosocial behaviour
constitutes an informal safety net whose benefits go beyond the donors
and recipients,66 and provides a buffer against adversities.67</p>
<p>We also investigated how a country could have both high deaths of
despair and high life evaluations. First, deaths of despair and life
evaluations reflect two related but distinct concepts. Second, our
empirical results indicate that different factors contribute to each
variable. Deaths of despair are more sensitive to the population
structure, while life evaluations are more sensitive to GDP per capita,
freedom, and social support. However, both variables are related to
components of prosocial behaviour. In particular, a rise in donations
similarly increases life evaluations as it decreases deaths of
despair.</p>
<p>Although much of the previous research on deaths of despair has
focussed on the United States, the trends documented in this chapter
illustrate that the US is not representative of global trends. In the US
and, to a lesser extent, Canada and the United Kingdom, deaths of
despair rapidly increased from 2000 to 2019, especially among men aged
30 to 59, due to increasing drug abuse. However, most countries
experienced decreasing deaths of despair over this period. Even among
the countries that did experience rising deaths of despair, the pattern
generally differed from the US. In these countries, the rise was due
largely to increasing alcohol abuse among men aged 45+. The Republic of
Korea exhibited yet another trend, experiencing a rise in suicides among
older men aged 60+. The existence of such unique trends motivates
additional research on deaths of despair around the world.</p>
<p>It is well established that prosocial behaviour contributes to
individual wellbeing and to societies in which people are more
supportive, cooperative, and trusting. This chapter further demonstrates
that increasing prosocial behaviour is reliably connected to decreasing
deaths of despair. Societies could benefit from investing in the
conditions supporting prosocial behaviour.</p>

<li><p>17 We present rates of deaths of despair as the number of deaths
per 100,000 for the population aged 15 and above because this allows us
to compare countries of different population sizes. Throughout the
chapter, we will use this normalisation. Any reference to the number of
deaths of despair is per 100,000.</p></li>
<li><p>18 23 100,000 x 55,000,000 ˜= 12,500. The population aged 15 and
above in the UK is approximately 55 million.</p></li>
<li><p>19 South Africa had fewer deaths of despair than Grenada.
However, the level of deaths of despair in South Africa were not very
comparable, because we had to adjust the figures for South Africa. Our
measure of suicides generally includes deaths due to undetermined
intent, in accordance with the literature as described in Online
Appendix A. However, due to a break in the series for South Africa, we
dropped deaths due to undetermined intent for South Africa, which
mechanically reduces their levels of deaths. This adjustment should not
greatly affect the changes in deaths of despair over time for South
Africa, and has thus been left in the rest of the sample.</p></li>
<li><p>20 Data are from the year 2019 for most countries. However,
Republic of Moldova uses the most recent available year, 2018. We focus
on the pre-COVID-19 period due to data availability and because the
pandemic might have affected prosocial behaviours and deaths of despair
in exceptional ways.</p></li>
<li><p>21 The WHO Mortality Database includes annual mortality
statistics by sex, age, and harmonised causes of death. Only countries
that record at least 65% of deaths with a specific cause, classified
according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) were
included by the WHO. The alternative WHO Health Inequality Data
Repository (https://whoequity.shinyapps.io/heat/) includes
similar</p></li>
<li><p>cause of death data by sex, in five year intervals from 2001 to
2021, and with more countries than the WHO Mortality Database. We use
the WHO Mortality Database for two reasons. First, the statistics from
both databases stem from the same source, i.e., the WHO Global Health
Estimates. However, the WHO Mortality Database only retains the
countries with reliable data (WHO 2020). Second, the WHO Health
Inequality Data Repository does not disaggregate by age nor include
annual data.</p></li>

<li><p>25 Snowdon and Choi (2020).</p></li>
<li><p>26 1,045 deaths per 100,000 is the average value of deaths from
all causes across countries in 2019, using the same sample of countries
and data from WHO Mortality Database on all cause mortality.</p></li>
<li><p>27 In economics, convergence refers to the observation that
countries with low initial Gross Domestic Product (GDP) exhibit faster
rates of GDP growth. This concept has been recently extended to changes
of social capital over time (Sarracino and Mikucka, 2017).</p></li>

<li><p>47 Each component is assessed through responses to the question:
“In the past month, have you done any of the following? A. Donated money
to a charity; B. Volunteered your time to an organisation; C. Helped a
stranger or someone you didn’t know who needed help.” For a discussion
of prosocial behaviour more generally, see Chapter 2.</p></li>
<li><p>48 Putnam (2000); Costa and Kahn (2001); Bartolini et
al. (2013).</p></li>
<li><p>49 We have identified too many relevant variables with
overlapping concepts. As opposed to subjectively choosing a subset of
variables, we perform a data-driven variable selection procedure. We
begin our analysis including each variable, then we sequentially drop
the least statistically significant variable one at a time and rerun the
regression. We continue this procedure until all of the retained
variables reach a specified level of statistical significance (with
t-statistics above 1.00). Through this procedure, we reduced our initial
set of 20 explanatory variables (including prosocial behaviour) to a set
of 7 without a significant drop in explanatory power. This analysis is
presented in Table B7 in the online appendix. For robustness, we also
used the alternative lasso approach for variable selection and retained
a similar set of variables.</p></li>
<li><p>50 Graham and Pinto (2021).</p></li>
<li><p>51 We omit the population shares 0–14 and 15–29 because it is
necessary to omit one group to estimate the model and our full sample is
based on ages 15+.</p></li>
<li><p>52 These groups also tend to have different labour market
statuses, which is important to account for in order for labour force
participation rate to capture the mechanism that we intend it to.
Decreases in the participation rate conditional on the population
structure are more likely to capture discouraged workers than students
or retirees.</p></li>

<li><p>55 Helliwell (2007).</p></li>
<li><p>56 For a discussion of latitude and suicide, see Helliwell
(2007).</p></li>
<li><p>57 The full set of controls before variable selection are in
Table B7 in the online appendix.</p></li>
<li><p>58 As evidenced by the adjusted R-squareds presented in Table B7
in the online appendix. They are nearly the same in the regression with
20 variables as in the regression with 7.</p></li>
<li><p>59 Case and Deaton (2022).</p></li>
<li><p>60 Social trust is the share of people (0–100) who respond “most
people can be trusted” to the following question: “Generally speaking,
would you say that most people can be trusted or that you need to be
very careful in dealing with people?” Group membership is the share of
people (0-100) who are a member of any of the following types of
organisation: (1) church or religious organisation, (2) sport or
recreational organisation, (3) art, music or educational organisation,
(4) environmental organisation.</p></li>
<li><p>61 As was found in earlier studies of suicides using earlier
samples of WVS data, and reported in Helliwell (2006, 2007) and
Helliwell and Wang (2011).</p></li>
<li><p>62 Helliwell (2007).</p></li>
<li><p>63 OECD (2013); Kapteyn et al. (2015).</p></li>
<li><p>64 This replicates the results using earlier WVS data, where both
memberships (and also social trust) were found to have the same
standardised effects in equations for life satisfaction and suicide
(Helliwell 2007, Figure 5).</p></li>
<li><p>65 Additional factors may simultaneously explain deaths of
despair in certain countries, such as those discussed in the
introduction (e.g., social and economic marginalisation). The focus in
this chapter has been on prosocial behaviour, the relation of which we
isolated from plausible alternative explanations (including numerous
economic and social variables) to provide a more reliable estimate of
its impact. We encourage researchers to explore additional explanations
in future analysis.</p></li>

<p>The decline in happiness and social trust in Europe and the US
explains a large share of the rise in political polarisation and
anti-system votes.</p>
<p>Subjective attitudes such as life satisfaction and trust play a much
greater role in shaping values and voting behaviour than traditional
ideologies or class struggle.</p>
<p>Unhappy people are attracted by the extremes of the political
spectrum. Low-trust people are found more often on the far right,
whereas high-trust people are more inclined to vote for the far
left.</p>
<p>We highlight the political implications of both the presence and
absence of caring and sharing practices.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-4"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>During the last decade, Western countries have seen a cascade of
anti-system political victories, from Brexit in 2015 to the election of
Donald Trump in 2024. During this period, resentment of ‘the system’ has
grown in most European countries, particularly in Austria, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and
Switzerland. Figure 7.1 illustrates the global rise in anti-system
populist parties over the 20th century, both on the far left and the far
right, with a sharp increase since the 1980s.</p>
<p>Voters question immigration and globalisation, protectionism is on
the rise, and attacks on experts and mainstream media are increasingly
common. At first glance, these patterns can be surprising, given the
historically unprecedented levels of prosperity and security after World
War II and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.</p>
<p>A number of studies suggest that this anti-system wave originates in
a loss of confidence in traditional political parties, both right and
left, and a more general loss of confidence in elites, giving rise to
“anti-party parties”.1 This loss of confidence in the system may be
attributed to economic factors – such as rising economic insecurity and
the economic consequences of globalisation, trade, and automation2 – or
cultural factors leading to a backlash against modernity and growing
hostility towards immigrants.3</p>
<p>These explanations rarely address the important question of why some
anti-system voters respond to these pressures by moving to the far left,
while others move to the far right.4 Equally puzzling are</p>
<p><img src="_page_197_Figure_7.jpeg" /></p>
<p>the different agendas of the populist right and the extreme left in
terms of income inequality and the persistent paradox that poor people,
who would benefit from income redistribution, often vote for parties
that oppose it.5</p>
<p>The recent victory of Donald Trump in 2024 is a perfect illustration
of this puzzle. Likewise, in the French context, during the first round
of the 2022 presidential election, anti-system parties, both from the
far left (La France Insoumise) and the far right (Rassemblement
National) gathered around 20% of the votes, often coming from the same
social background. Le Pen, the populist right candidate, and Mélenchon,
the extreme left candidate, are both able to attract the votes of
similar anti-system, blue-collar workers despite proposing very
different policy programs on immigration and redistribution.</p>
<p>To explain these patterns of political behaviour, one must
acknowledge the decline of the traditional class-based divide in voting
behaviour and search for a new framework that can explain the rise in
anti-system votes. In particular, why they flow either to the populist
right (with anti-redistribution, anti-immigrant, and more parochial
ideology) or the far left (pro-redistribution, pro-immigrant, and more
universalist values).</p>
<p>In this chapter, we propose such a framework, where subjective
attitudes such as life satisfaction and interpersonal trust play a
crucial role. In the context of post-industrial societies that have
become increasingly individualistic, subjective attitudes play a much
greater role in shaping values and voting behaviour than traditional
ideologies or class struggle. In line with previous findings,6 we show
that (low) life satisfaction is highly related to distrust in
institutions and voting preferences for anti-system candidates, both in
the United States (US) and in Europe, using various international
databases.</p>
<p>Then we highlight a key new element: the role of social trust in
explaining how these anti-system forces are oriented to the right or
left of the political spectrum. Far-left voters have a higher level of
social trust, while right-wing populists have a very low level of social
trust. For the populist right, this low trust is not limited to</p>
<p><em>Far-left voters have a higher level of social trust, while
right-wing populists have a very low level of social trust.</em></p>
<p>strangers, but also extends to others in general, from homosexuals to
their own neighbours. The xenophobic inclination of the populist right,
well-documented worldwide,7 seems to be a particular case of a broader
distrust towards the rest of society. Right-wing populists throughout
the world share xenophobic and anti-immigration inclinations. The Sweden
Democrats, the Danish People’s Party, the Finns Party, the Freedom Party
of Austria, Greece’s Golden Dawn, the Northern League and Fratelli in
Italy, the National Rally in France, and a fraction of the Republican
Party in the US are all built on strong anti-immigration
foundations.</p>
<p>To encompass these patterns in a unifying framework, we construct a
matrix of interpersonal trust and life satisfaction and show how voters
in the United States and Western Europe are positioned in the matrix
over the last decade. We test the relevance of this framework by
combining various databases: the Gallup World Poll (2004–2024), the
European Social Survey (2002–2023), the General Social Survey
(1970–2023), and the World Values Survey (1981–2023). We show how our
new paradigm offers additional insight for a more general analysis of
political preferences. In particular, how social trust and life
satisfaction combine to explain otherwise puzzling ideological
attitudes. For example, why populist right-wing voters, while poorer
than the average, tend not to support income redistribution
policies.</p>
<p>An additional key element is to explain the rise of anti-system
parties over time. If happiness and social trust can explain anti-system
votes and ideologies not only in cross-section but also over time, we
should see both attitudes moving in opposite directions over the last
decade, especially among particular groups of people. We show, with the
new release of the Gallup data, an acceleration in the decrease of life
satisfaction</p>
<p>in the US and, to a lesser extent, in Western European countries, as
already documented in <em>World Happiness Report 2024</em>. 8</p>
<p>We also provide new evidence for a strong decline in social trust. As
an illustration, the share of American people who trust others has
almost halved since the 1970s, dropping from 50% to 30%. These new
findings resonate with Bob Putnam’s seminal book, <em>Bowling
Alone</em>, and with the original data discussed in Chapter 3 of this
report,9 that documents a sharp increase in the number of Americans who
dine alone every day of the week. We show that the country-wide
evolution of happiness and trust is highly associated with the rise in
the likelihood of voting for anti-system parties in Western Europe and
the United States, and discuss the groups of people whose life
satisfaction and social trust have declined the most during this period,
pushing them to antisystem and populist parties.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-paradigm-to-explain-anti-system-votes"><strong>A new
paradigm to explain anti-system votes</strong></h2>
<p>A growing literature has established the importance of looking at
subjective attitudes, such as life satisfaction, for explaining voting
behaviour. In particular, it has already been shown that unhappy people
have less faith in political parties and the political system, are more
likely to agree with authoritarian ideas such as having a strong leader
to rule the country, and are more likely to reject incumbents, both in
the European and Brexit contexts.10 In the US context, low life
satisfaction was highly predictive of Trump’s election victory in
2016.11 In addition, negative emotions measured by international surveys
and social media, were also highly predictive of populist votes in the
US and Western Europe.12</p>
<p>This evidence adds to the extensive literature documenting the
political consequences of economic shocks and risks such as the
financial crisis, globalisation, and the rise in income inequality. It
makes a crucial addition by showing how measures of life satisfaction
capture the impact of these shocks on life experience much more
accurately than simple socio-demographic measures. It also shows how
these negative</p>
<p><em>Our contribution here is to show the importance of adding social
trust as a second dimension – in addition to life satisfaction – to
understand the partitioning of unsatisfied citizens into the far left or
far right.</em></p>
<p>subjective experiences translate into the blaming of institutions and
elites for offering insufficient protection from these shocks.</p>
<p>Yet, this literature cannot explain why unhappy voters turn either to
the left or to the right along the spectrum of anti-system parties, nor
their different ideologies (i.e., economic and cultural values). Our
contribution here is to show the importance of adding social trust as a
second dimension – in addition to life satisfaction – to understand the
partitioning of unsatisfied citizens into the far left or far right. We
also pay attention to abstainers, whose lack of social inclusion is
associated with a withdrawal from the political game and the refusal to
vote. This is particularly revealing in the case of the United States,
where this behaviour represents an addition to the limited options
offered by the bi-partisan system.</p>
<p>This partitioning resonates with previous work showing the role of
universalist versus parochial moral values in the rise of the pro-Trump
vote in the US context.13 It also talks to other studies that have
identified cultural causes as the root of the upswing in populism. For
instance, Inglehart and Norris claim that populist voting is mainly
driven by the generation born between the two World Wars, driven by a
rejection of cultural modernity, diversity, and the emancipation of
women and sexual minorities.14 However, these traditional explanations
fall short of explaining why, in some countries, populist platforms
attract at least as much support from the youth as from the older
generation. The rise in populist votes is ubiquitous, cutting across
generations and categories. Cultural backlash is equally unable to
explain the dramatic drop in trust in government observed throughout</p>
<p>the Western world, across all cohorts. Economic factors are also
unable to explain why there is a strong xenophobic undercurrent in some
antisystem parties but not others, or why many populist parties and
their poor constituencies are hostile to income redistribution
policies.</p>
<p>Instead, we build on abundant social science research showing how
social trust shapes ideologies. This literature shows how an important
part of economic values – in particular citizens’ predisposition to pay
taxes, finance public goods, or favour more or less redistributive
policies – is related to the level of social trust. For example, the
willingness to pay taxes depends on the belief that others are also
contributing their share, a finding confirmed by laboratory experiments
of</p>
<p>public good games on the funding of collective services.15 People who
are most in favour of redistribution and, more generally, countries
where the welfare state system is more generous, have higher levels of
trust. By contrast, distrust undermines support for income
redistribution. In the French context, trust explains a large share of
economic and cultural values, especially attitudes towards immigration
or homosexuality.16</p>
<p>The two diagrams below illustrate our proposed paradigm. Figure 7.2A
shows how life satisfaction and social trust explain ideologies (both
cultural and economic attitudes) and political attitudes and votes.
Figure 7.2B shows how life satisfaction and social trust are both
necessary to fully understand anti-system movements.</p>
<p><img src="_page_200_Figure_5.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_201_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>In the following sections, we apply this paradigm using several
individual-level, cross-national surveys that contain information on
subjective life evaluation, trust in others, and values in Western
Europe and the United States.17 In the next section, we show the
relationship between these variables and political, economic, and
cultural values (corresponding to arrow 1 of Figure 7.2A). In the
following section, we illustrate the political consequences of these
attitudes on votes (arrows 2 and 3 of Figure 7.2A and the partitioning
in Figure 7.2B).</p>
<h2
id="the-influence-of-life-satisfaction-and-trust-on-ideology"><strong>The
influence of life satisfaction and trust on ideology</strong></h2>
<p>We start by illustrating the relationship between life satisfaction
and social trust, on the one hand, and political, cultural, and economic
values on the other hand.</p>
<p>Life satisfaction is measured with the question, “Are you satisfied
with your life in general?” with responses on a scale from 0 (very
dissatisfied) to 10 (very satisfied). Social trust is measured by
interpersonal trust, which is the trust that people have in other
people. Importantly, it is different from institutional trust, which is
the trust that people have in institutions (government, parliament,
legal, etc.). To measure interpersonal trust, we use the question, “In
general, would you say that most people can be trusted or that one can
never be too careful when dealing with others?”</p>
<p>This question has become a standard reference in international
surveys for estimating the social fabric in a society, and the ability
to cooperate outside the family and the private circle. We also propose
additional measures of social trust based on concrete measures of social
relationships.</p>
<p>We implement our framework and look at the interplay between life
satisfaction and social trust. For simplicity, we split the population
of each country into high trust versus low trust groups and into high
life satisfaction versus low life satisfaction (as compared to the
median level). We then represent the average values of the four groups
defined by this partition.</p>
<h4 id="political-values"><strong>Political values</strong></h4>
<p>Figure 7.3 shows how satisfaction with democracy is associated with
life satisfaction and interpersonal trust using individual estimates in
Europe and the US and controlling for income, education, gender, and
age. Results for trust in the parliament, the legal system, politicians,
and support of European integration are reported in the online
appendix.</p>
<p>The green dots at the right of the figure represent the attitudes of
individuals who declare a high level of life satisfaction and trust.
Compared with</p>
<p>this benchmark, the other coloured dots correspond to the three other
groups: high life satisfaction and low trust (orange), low life
satisfaction and low trust (pink), and low life satisfaction and high
trust (blue).</p>
<p>As can be seen, dissatisfaction with democracy is particularly high
when people express a low level of life satisfaction (pink and blue),
especially in Europe. This is true whether they have a high (blue) or
low (pink) level of social trust. In Europe, people with low life
satisfaction and low social trust (pink) are 1.8 points less satisfied
with democracy compared to the baseline, on a 0–10 scale. For the US, it
is 0.8 points. People with high social trust but low life satisfaction
(blue) also tend to be highly dissatisfied with democracy compared to
their counterparts with high life satisfaction (green). We find similar
results for distrust in legal institutions.</p>
<p>The main takeaway of this first finding is the anti-system political
attitudes of citizens with the lowest level of life satisfaction. Those
who are dissatisfied with their lives may feel that the system has
failed them and consider that the democratic system and legal
institutions have not protected them against life risks.</p>
<p><img src="_page_202_Picture_9.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_203_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<h4 id="cultural-values"><strong>Cultural values</strong></h4>
<p>The group of citizens with the lowest level of satisfaction, the
anti-system group, is divided in terms of cultural values and what
should replace ‘the system’, depending on their level of social trust.
Figure 7.4 shows that social trust is the main predictor of the cultural
divide in terms of attitudes towards homosexuality and immigration. We
measure positive attitudes towards</p>
<p>homosexuality with questions on whether gay and lesbian people should
be able to adopt children (in the US) or are free to live their lives as
they wish (in Europe). We measure positive attitudes towards immigrants
with questions on whether immigrants are good for the country’s economy
or could take the jobs of natives.</p>
<p>The crucial role of social trust in shaping cultural values is
powerfully illustrated by the contrast</p>
<p>between the two groups of citizens with low life satisfaction. The
attitudes of those with low trust (pink) are almost twice as negative as
those with high trust (blue). These less satisfied but trusting citizens
(blue) are more tolerant towards homosexuality and immigration than
highly satisfied but distrusting people (orange). Thus, unlike political
ideology, which maps onto the distribution of life satisfaction, the
distribution of cultural ideology is aligned along the axis of
interpersonal trust, as shown earlier in Figure 7.2B.</p>
<h4 id="economic-values"><strong>Economic values</strong></h4>
<p>The same patterns hold for the relationships between life
satisfaction, social trust, and economic values. Social trust appears as
the main predictor of the ideological divide in terms</p>
<p><img src="_page_204_Figure_5.jpeg" /></p>
<p>of income redistribution. We measure attitudes towards redistribution
using a question that asks whether “Government should reduce differences
in income levels” (1–10 scale) for Europe and “There should be greater
incentives for individual effort” versus “Incomes should be made more
equal” (1–10 scale) for the United States.</p>
<p>Figure 7.5 shows that support for income redistribution is generally
associated with higher social trust and lower life satisfaction (blue).
Those who are highly satisfied but less trusting (orange) are the ones
who most often oppose income redistribution. The contrast is even more
salient within the group of citizens with the lowest life satisfaction.
They are less supportive of income redistribution if they have a low
level of interpersonal trust (pink) and more in favour if they trust
others (blue).</p>
<p><img src="_page_205_Figure_4.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Citizens with low interpersonal trust may be sceptical of the social
contract and doubt reciprocity on behalf of other people. Indeed, the
economic literature has shown that the level of interpersonal trust
explains an important part of citizens’ predisposition to finance public
goods, pay taxes, or support redistributive policies.18 This sheds light
on the key puzzle of why a large part of the working class, who are the
least satisfied with life in general, might vote for parties that oppose
redistributive policies.</p>
<h2
id="the-influence-of-life-satisfaction-and-trust-on-voting-behaviour"><strong>The
influence of life satisfaction and trust on voting
behaviour</strong></h2>
<p>We now turn to voting behaviour. First, we study the connection
between life satisfaction, interpersonal trust, and votes (the second
arrow of Figure 7.2A) and then the relationship between economic and
cultural values and votes (the third arrow of Figure 7.2A).</p>
<h4 id="western-europe"><strong>Western Europe</strong></h4>
<p>In Western Europe, Table 7.1 shows that high levels of life
satisfaction are negatively associated with votes for far-left and
far-right parties at the last national election. By contrast, voters for
centre-left and centre-right parties are more satisfied with their lives
on average. However, a low level of trust is only associated with an
attraction to the far right, and to a lesser extent to the right, but
not to the left and the far left.</p>
<p>Figure 7.6 shows that, in Western Europe, far-left and far-right
voters both declare low levels of life</p>

<p>satisfaction but are symmetrically positioned on high trust (far
left) and low trust (far right) levels. This is consistent with our
previous findings on political, economic, and cultural values.
Anti-system ideology and institutional distrust are related to low life
satisfaction but low life satisfaction alone is not sufficient to
generate a populist far-right movement. The populist right requires the
dimension of low interpersonal trust which is associated with
anti-immigration and anti-redistribution attitudes.</p>
<p>Figure 7.7 highlights these results for a selection of European
countries from the south (Spain), the centre (France and Germany), and
the north (Sweden). In all countries, far-right voters stand much lower
on social trust measures than electors for any other political party. In
general, voters for centre-right, or centre-left parties have
aboveaverage life satisfaction and social trust.</p>
<p>The French elections are a textbook illustration of our paradigm.
There, both the far left (Mélenchon) and the far right (Le Pen) have
prominent electorates (18–25% in the 2017 and 2022 presidential
elections). Citizens with high interpersonal trust are more likely to
vote for the left and those with lower trust are more likely to</p>
<p><img src="_page_207_Figure_5.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_208_Figure_3.jpeg" /></p>
<p>vote for the right. Le Pen and Mélenchon voters share a low level of
life satisfaction but differ in terms of trust. The centre electorate is
embodied by Emmanuel Macron, with high life satisfaction and high trust,
which correspond to wealthier people with liberal and pro-European
values. In contrast, those who vote for centre-right parties are
satisfied with life (mainly due to their high income) but are less
trusting. We find the same patterns among anti-system parties in Germany
(Die Linke versus AfD ) and Spain (Podemos versus Vox).</p>
<h4 id="united-states"><strong>United States</strong></h4>
<p>Our framework is more difficult to apply in the US bi-partisan system
(Democrats versus Republicans) that protects the parties from
splintering. When applying our framework, we uncover a great schism, not
only between political parties but also between voters and abstainers,
where the latter display the lowest levels of life satisfaction and</p>
<p>interpersonal trust. In the US, this group of citizens, who can be
considered as the anomic, are not represented by a party.</p>
<p>We focus specifically on the two presidential elections in 2016 and
2020 which are associated with the upsurge of votes for Trump. Although
survey data on the 2024 elections are not available yet, we use data on
voters’ preferences across candidates in the two previous primaries and
general presidential elections.</p>
<p>In a multi-party system, voters can choose – or create – a party that
corresponds to their preferences over several important dimensions. In a
two-party system, the parties often take opposite positions on each
salient policy issue, which eventually shapes the nature of
polarisation: politicians and voters are divided along a single
dimension which aggregates several issues. On the other hand, each of
the two parties effectively represents a coalition of voters who support
different policy</p>
<p><img src="_page_209_Figure_7.jpeg" /></p>
<p>stances on various dimensions. In our analysis, we try to identify
such subgroups to understand their characteristics and their voting
behaviour.</p>
<p>Figures 7.8A and 7.8B illustrate votes in 2016 and 2020 for primary
and presidential elections.</p>
<p>In 2016, votes for Hillary Clinton were votes for the status quo,
coming from people with high trust and high life satisfaction. Clinton
voters are wealthier than the average (which is highly correlated with
their life satisfaction) and their high level of trust makes them more
favourable to immigration and globalisation. Sanders voters also express
a higher level of trust than the average, but a lower level of life
satisfaction. This pattern explains why they vote for a candidate whose
main campaign motto was about the redistribution of income and taxation
of the wealthiest. Trump voters displayed different features. Their
level of life satisfaction is slightly higher than the national average
(this is due to the composition of this electorate, combining both the
white working and middle class and the wealthy), but a low level of
trust. This is consistent with both the anti-tax and anti-immigration
platform of Trump.</p>
<p><img src="_page_210_Figure_5.jpeg" /></p>
<p>In 2020, Donald Trump was the only Republican candidate. The rally of
traditional wealthy Republican voters (who voted for other Republican
candidates in the 2016 presidential primaries) explains this group’s
above-average life satisfaction and average level of trust. By contrast,
all Democrat voters displayed low life satisfaction and average or
above-average levels of trust.</p>
<p>The most striking feature in the 2016 and 2020 US elections is the
low levels of life satisfaction and trust of abstainers compared to
voters. While in Europe, the ‘anomics’ turn to the far-right parties, in
the US they withdraw from public life.</p>
<p>To dig deeper, we use a unique 2021 survey conducted by the market
research company, Bilendi, on a representative sample of 15,000 US
citizens. The survey asked about voting behaviour during the 2016 and
2020 presidential elections alongside specific questions on life
satisfaction and various dimensions of trust and ideology.19</p>
<p>Figure 7.9A illustrates the schism between abstainers and voters
across four dimensions of life satisfaction. Abstainers report higher
solitude both at work and in life, lower life satisfaction, and less
optimism for the future. The situation of abstentionists worsens between
the two elections. Their life satisfaction is 31 percentage points lower
than average in 2016, and this increases to 39 percentage points in
2020.</p>
<p>Figure 7.9B shows that abstainers have consistently lower trust than
voters in every dimension. They tend to distrust their own family or
friends (30 percentage points lower than the average) almost as much as
strangers (36 percentage points) and others in general (41 percentage
points).</p>
<p>Figure 7.9C shows that abstainers display a specific distrust in
institutions. In particular, they had lower than average trust in courts
(39 percentage points), police (37 percentage points), and government
(30 percentage points) in 2020. This dramatic low level of institutional
trust has deteriorated between 2016 and 2020.</p>
<p><img src="_page_211_Figure_7.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_212_Figure_2.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_212_Figure_4.jpeg" /></p>
<p>This pattern is quite different from the divide between Democrat and
Republican voters. In Figure 7.10, we break down their level of trust by
education (non-college versus college degree) and age (under 45 versus
over 45). The most striking result concerns the differences between
trust in one’s private circle (family, friends, and neighbours) and
trust in open society. Democrat voters have a lower-than-average level
of</p>
<p>parochial trust, but a much higher-than-average level of trust in
strangers. The picture is reversed among Trump voters. Strikingly, this
result applies to all generations and education levels.</p>

<p>Table 7.2A shows that all measures of political trust are negatively
correlated with far left and far right positioning. Table 7.2B displays
the expected relationship between support for income redistribution and
equal opportunities versus political positioning and votes. In
particular, the far left is more in favour of redistribution and the far
right is less in favour compared to the centre. The table also shows the
expected relationship between cultural attitudes and voting behaviour
with the far right much less tolerant towards immigration</p>
<p>and same-sex couples. In terms of magnitude, income redistribution
matters much more for the low-satisfaction, high-trust voters of the far
left and immigration is the obsession of the low-satisfaction, low-trust
voters of the far right.</p>
<h4 id="united-states-1"><strong>United States</strong></h4>
<p>Similarly in the US case, Trump voters oppose income redistribution
and are generally against government intervention. They are also much
less supportive of immigration and much less tolerant towards
homosexuality (Table 7.3).</p>

<p>Note: Weighted least squares. Additional controls: gender, income,
age, education level. “Trump” is a binary variable equal to 1 when an
individual voted for Trump in the 2020 presidential primary election and
0 otherwise.</p>
<p>Figure 7.11 details these ideological patterns for the 2020 US
primary elections across six ideological dimensions:
<strong>nationalist</strong> is measured with questions about
anti-immigration and protectionism; <strong>progressive</strong>
measures support for homosexuality, affirmative actions, and gun
controls; <strong>security</strong> measures support for spending on
police and defence; <strong>anti-elite</strong> measures negative
attitudes towards experts, scientists, MPs, and judges;
<strong>government spending</strong> measures attitudes towards taxes on
millionaires, income redistribution, and reduction of income
inequalities; and</p>
<p><strong>institutional trust</strong> measures trust in institutions
and science and whether elections are fair. Democrat voters are much
more in favor of immigration, sexual minorities, redistribution, and
much less anti-elite and pro-security than the average. Trump voters
display the exact opposite cultural and economic values. This pattern of
attitudes holds irrespective of socio-demographics and are well captured
by life satisfaction and interpersonal trust.</p>

<h2 id="time-trends"><strong>Time trends</strong></h2>
<p>We started this chapter by noting the rising support for far-right
and far-left parties and then sketching the patterns relating subjective
attitudes and economic and cultural values with political votes.
Therefore, we expect to observe parallel trends in the evolution of
these variables over time. Figure 7.12 shows a sharp fall in life
satisfaction in the US, already documented in <em>World Happiness Report
2023</em>. The trend is less clear in Western Europe where the initial
level of life satisfaction is lower.</p>
<p>It is important to underline that this fall in life satisfaction is
not driven by income. To illustrate this, each dot in Figure 7.13 plots
life satisfaction and GDP per capita (adjusted for inflation) since
2006. The association between income and life satisfaction is usually
found to be positive in the short run, but better represented by a flat
trend in the long run.20 But here, in the 2000s, the association is
negative. The time trend in life satisfaction is clearly decreasing in
the United States, although GDP per capita is rising over time. The
picture is similar in European countries,</p>
<p><img src="_page_218_Picture_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_218_Figure_3.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_219_Picture_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_220_Figure_2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>especially since the 2020s, where GDP per capita is rising, but
happiness is decreasing on average and in most European countries.</p>
<p>Figure 7.14A shows that social trust is also clearly decreasing in
the US and Western Europe, with a drop of 10 percentage points in the
two continents over the period. Even more strikingly, in Figure 7.14B we
see that the percentage of people in the US who trust others has
decreased by 20 percentage points since the early 1970s, from 50% to
30%. The evidence is more mixed in Europe, pointing to overall
stability.</p>
<p>The sharp drop in social trust in the US is consistent with the fact
that rising unhappiness has shifted voters almost exclusively towards
the populist right (Donald Trump), and not towards the left (Bernie
Sanders). The relative decline or stability in social trust in Europe is
consistent with the fact that the decline in life satisfaction has split
the unsatisfied electorate between the two opposite extremes of the
political spectrum, depending on their level of social trust. Therefore,
the next section investigates which groups of citizens have experienced
the most significant variation in life satisfaction and social trust, in
order to understand the evolution of anti-system voting behaviour.</p>

<h4 id="population-sub-groups"><strong>Population
sub-groups</strong></h4>
<p>The trends in attitudes, values, and voting behaviour that we have
described are particularly pronounced among certain groups of the
population. This sheds additional light on the underlying factors
shaping the rise in anti-system votes.</p>
<p>Figure 7.15 displays the average change in life satisfaction for
different population groups based on age, gender, education, economic
status, and geography. The groups with increasing life satisfaction
stand to the right of the dotted vertical bar and the groups with
decreasing satisfaction stand to the left. The vertical axis shows the
initial level of life satisfaction measured in 2006. The downward trend
in life satisfaction is particularly steep among young people under
30,</p>
<p>especially women, both in Western Europe and the United States, as
already underlined in <em>World Happiness Report 2024</em>.</p>
<p>In terms of social trust, Figure 7.16 shows that, in the US, the
average yearly change is negative for all groups, especially for people
aged 30–44.</p>
<p>Figures 7.15 and 7.16 also illustrate the importance of financial
difficulties. A very strong gradient opposes those who live comfortably
on their income and those who find it difficult or very difficult.
Education level also makes a difference. People with primary or
secondary education endure a larger fall in life satisfaction than those
with tertiary education. These are the groups that have shifted to
anti-system votes.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-3"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>In this chapter, we have documented a parallel fall in life
satisfaction and social trust and its relationship with the rise in
anti-system votes since the early 2000s. We propose a model of the
relationships between three blocs of attitudes: (i) life satisfaction
and social trust, (ii) cultural, political, and economic values, and
(iii) voting behaviour. We show that low life satisfaction comes with
anti-system attitudes while people’s level of social trust determines
their orientation towards anti-system parties at the left or the right.
In Europe, citizens with low life satisfaction and low social trust, the
‘anomics’, tend to vote for far-right parties. In the context of the US
two-party system, they tend to abstain and withdraw from public
life.</p>
<p>The fall in life satisfaction cannot be explained by economic growth,
at least not by average national income, as GDP per capita has been on
the rise in the US and Western Europe since the mid-2000s. Rather, it
could be blamed on the feelings of financial insecurity and loneliness
experienced by Americans and Europeans – two symptoms of a damaged
social fabric. It is driven by almost all social categories, but in
particular, by the rural, the less-educated, and, quite strikingly, by
the younger generation. This low level of life satisfaction is a
breeding ground for populism and the lack of social trust is behind the
political success of the far right.</p>

<h2 id="key-insights-6"><strong>Key Insights</strong></h2>
<p>The cost-effectiveness of charities can be measured and compared with
a standardised metric of value: wellbeing-years (WELLBYs).</p>
<p>In the first global review of published evidence, we find that the
cost-effectiveness of charities varies dramatically. The best charities
in our sample are hundreds of times better at increasing happiness per
dollar than others. Therefore, you can multiply your impact at no extra
cost by funding more cost-effective charities.</p>
<p>There are no published evaluations of large, well-known charities or
typical acts of charitable giving, such as helping the homeless, using a
wellbeing approach. We present some rough evaluations of these cases but
find them to be less cost-effective than nearly all the charities in our
sample.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-5"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>We hope that if you’re reading this, you’re not just
<em>interested</em> in world happiness, you want to <em>do
something</em> about it. But, what can you do? This chapter focuses on
something many of us already do and nearly all of us can do: give to
charity. Each year, over a billion people donate more than $500 billion
to charity,1 driven in large part by a desire to help others.2</p>
<p>However, there are many worthy problems in the world, our resources
are limited, and we don’t want to waste our money. So, how can you get
real change for your dollar? More specifically, how can you make the
biggest difference to world happiness with what you have to spare?</p>
<p>People say “money can’t buy happiness”. At the Happier Lives
Institute, we reject that claim but with a twist. We show that money
<em>can</em> buy happiness <em>for other people</em> and we highlight
the ‘best buys’ that have been identified so far. To do this, we compare
the impact of charities using wellbeingyears (WELLBYs) per dollar, a
method we will explain in due course.</p>
<p>In the first global review of published evidence, we find the best
charities are hundreds of times better than others. This means you have
an opportunity to make a far greater difference to world happiness, at
no extra cost to yourself, simply by changing where you donate. If a
friend told you they gave $200,000 to a charity, you’d probably be
extremely impressed – that could be their life savings! However, it’s
possible to have that sort of <em>impact</em> for a fraction of the
cost: giving $1,000 to the best charities may do just as much good as
$200,000 to a randomly selected one.</p>
<p>You may be familiar with the claim – widely made in the effective
altruism movement3 and endorsed in a survey of charity experts4 – that
the top charities are a hundred times more impactful than the average
charity. While this claim is believable, we are unaware of any research
that demonstrates, or even tests this, with evidence. Indeed, we cannot
think of any attempts to assess the cost-effectiveness of a
representative sample of charities – a necessary first step for
comparing ‘the average’ to ‘the best’. The most relevant work we know of
finds that health interventions can</p>
<p><em>In the first global review of published evidence, we find the

<p>differ dramatically in cost-effectiveness (when measured with a
standard health metric).5 This suggests, but doesn’t demonstrate, that
the same may be true for charities. Our analysis provides the most
direct test (we know of) for the claim that the best charities can be a
hundred times more cost-effective than others.</p>
<p>We begin the chapter by introducing some key ideas behind our
empirical comparison of charities. This includes brief discussions of
effective giving, the focus on wellbeing, the WELLBY, and assessing
charity cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>We then turn to the main part of the chapter: a global comparison of
charity cost-effectiveness. Scientific research into happiness has been
growing for decades. In recent years, around 4,000 papers are published
annually on the topic6 and at least 24 countries now measure subjective
wellbeing routinely.7 However, efforts to find the most cost-effective
ways to improve happiness are only getting started. A handful of WELLBYs
per dollar estimates for charities and policies have been produced in
the last 10 years. We found 24 estimates of different charities from
four different evaluators. While this is neither a large nor
representative sample of evaluations, it does cover a variety of
charitable activities across the world. Our emphasis is on the
variability in cost-effectiveness and the ability of research to reveal
this, rather than the specific ‘winners’ and ‘losers’. Given the newness
of this field, we want to spark interest from donors and researchers,
not draw definite conclusions.</p>
<p>This sample of pre-existing estimates has two key gaps: it doesn’t
include any of the biggest and most well-known NGOs or any typical acts
of charity, such as helping the homeless. How do these two options
compare to the charities in our sample? We explain why it’s hard to
estimate the cost-effectiveness of many charities using WELLBYs,
particularly for Multi-Armed NGOs (MANGOs) that run many programmes. We
attempt to partially fill the gap by providing</p>
<p>back-of-the-envelope calculations for a couple of well-known NGOs and
for helping the homeless in wealthy countries. Our tentative conclusion
is that the top charities in our sample are likely to be considerably
more impactful per dollar than the missing options.</p>
<p>In the final parts of the chapter, we anticipate questions and
objections and set out directions for further work.</p>
<p><img src="_page_232_Picture_4.jpeg" /></p>
<h2 id="effective-giving-a-wellbeing-approach"><strong>Effective giving:
a wellbeing approach</strong></h2>
<p>We expect many readers of the <em>World Happiness Report</em> will
like the idea of finding and supporting the charities that make the most
difference, per dollar, to world happiness. But, we don’t want to assume
readers have thought about why and how to do this. Before we get to the
empirical analysis, we motivate and explain the project. For ease of
reading, we have split up the various ideas. Readers familiar with these
should feel free to skip over them.</p>
<h4 id="why-give-at-all"><strong>Why give at all</strong></h4>
<p>The classic argument for giving to charity comes from the philosopher
Peter Singer. He asks us to imagine we are walking past a shallow pond
when we suddenly see that a child is drowning.8 We can jump in and save
that child, but this will ruin our expensive new suit. Are we morally
required to save the child at some cost to ourselves? The reaction most
people have is that we must wade in. The principle that appears to
explain this reaction is that, as Singer puts it, “if it is in our power
to prevent something bad from happening without thereby sacrificing
anything of comparable importance, we ought, morally, to do it”.9</p>
<p>This dilemma is not merely theoretical. People are suffering all
around the world. Even if we can’t help them directly, we could give
some share of our income – perhaps 1% – to charities that can. This may
not feel the same as doing it ourselves when the person is right in
front of us, but the outcome may be identical. It seems that, if we have
a moral duty to rescue the child, we have a moral duty to give something
to charity.10</p>
<p>You may not feel wealthy enough to give, but you’re probably
wealthier than you think.</p>
<p><em>You may not feel wealthy enough to give, but you’re probably
wealthier than you think. If you earn the median US salary ($42k), you
are in the top 2% of the global income distribution.</em></p>
<p>If you earn the median United States (US) salary ($42k), you are in
the top 2% of the global income distribution.11 What’s more, humans have
existed for a few hundred thousand years and the world has never been
wealthier.12 Believe it or not, you may be one of the richest people who
has ever lived.</p>
<p>That’s the stern, ‘bad cop’ argument for giving, but we can offer a
‘good cop’ one too: altruism is its own reward. Research shows that
prosocial behaviour – and charitable giving in particular – improve
self-reported wellbeing.13 This is no surprise if you’ve ever felt the
warm glow of giving a gift to family or showing kindness to a stranger.
Other chapters in this edition of the <em>World Happiness Report</em>
also show the importance of prosocial behaviour. Chapter 2 highlights
how having a clear sense of one’s positive impact increases its reward
to wellbeing. This chapter will give you clear information about how
impactful your charitable donations can be. If you are not sure if
giving will make you happier, why not try it and find out?</p>
<h4 id="why-to-give-effectively"><strong>Why to give
effectively</strong></h4>
<p>This chapter will be most useful for those who want to give
effectively i.e., to make the biggest (or at least, a bigger) difference
with their donations based on evidence.</p>
<p>The argument for effective giving is simple: if you can make a bigger
difference to others without a significant extra cost to yourself, you
should do so. As we’ve already said and later show, this is not merely
hypothetical: some charities are much more impactful than others, in
terms of the happiness they create per dollar.</p>
<p>Not everyone is, or wants to be, an ‘effective giver’.14 Research has
found that people are not effective givers due to: (A) information, they
don’t know how or where to give effectively, and (B) motivation, they
prefer to support causes they are attached to, even if this would have
less impact.15</p>
<p>At first glance, it’s understandable that few donors seek information
on charity cost-effectiveness. According to recent research, donors
predict that the best charities helping the global poor are only 1.5
times better than the average ones.16 If you</p>
<p><em>We may feel a greater bond with those who are close to us, but we
may want to look beyond that if we can make a much bigger difference to
those further away.</em></p>
<p>believe that charities don’t differ much by costeffectiveness, it
doesn’t make sense to invest time looking for a slightly better option.
However, the evidence in this chapter shows that this belief is
misplaced.</p>
<p>Research has also found that people focus too much on overheads
(i.e., non-programme expenses like office costs and management salaries)
and mistakenly think that charities with higher overheads must be less
cost-effective.17 When donors realise that overheads and
cost-effectiveness can diverge, they give more to charities with higher
cost-effectiveness. To make this point, consider a hypothetical charity,
Donuts for Billionaires, which uses volunteers and spends 100% of its
money on snacks for the world’s wealthiest people: no overheads, but not
cost-effective. All the estimates we present in this chapter integrate
the overheads when calculating cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>Regarding motivation, it’s understandable that people want to support
projects close to their hearts – particularly if you think all charities
are about as cost-effective as each other, or it’s hard to compare them.
Someone might want to support a charity that works on a particular
health condition because a family member suffers from it. If this sounds
like you, ask yourself this: do you care about that specific health
problem, or do you care about it because of the impact it has, for
instance the suffering it causes? If your ultimate goal is to have an
impact, you may want to choose another charity that is better at
achieving that objective.</p>
<p>People say that charity “begins at home”, but we don’t think it
should end there. We may feel a greater bond with those who are close to
us, but we may want to look beyond that if we can make a much bigger
difference to those further away. We encourage readers to consider the
global impact they could have.</p>
<p>Finally, the choice between giving to what makes you feel good and
what does the most good doesn’t have to be all or nothing. A middle
option here is to split your donations, something we return to in the
section on objections.</p>
<h4 id="assessing-charity-impact-on-wellbeing"><strong>Assessing charity
impact on wellbeing</strong></h4>
<p>Our analysis defines ‘impact’ in terms of changes to overall
wellbeing. More conventional approaches might focus on poverty or
health. However, we don’t believe that improving poverty or health is
the ultimate goal. Rather, the ultimate goal is to help people live
happier lives. We should think of health and wealth as <em>means to an
end</em>: the end being happiness.18 Here’s a test. If you gave to
charity and it had no impact on anyone’s happiness, nor reduced any
suffering, would you be disappointed? If you would, that suggests you
believe happiness is what ultimately matters.</p>
<h4 id="quantifying-charity-impact-in-wellbys"><strong>Quantifying
charity impact in WELLBYs</strong></h4>
<p>We quantify impact using wellbeing-years (WELLBYs).19 One WELLBY is
equivalent to a 1-point increase on a 0–10 self-reported wellbeing scale
(typically life satisfaction) for 1 person for 1 year. So, if your
wellbeing went from 6/10 to 7/10 for two years, that would be a gain of
2 WELLBYs.</p>
<p>Data from self-reported wellbeing questions, such as life
satisfaction, are increasingly common20 and widely viewed as
meaningful.21 The <em>World Happiness Report</em> uses a life evaluation
question for its global ranking of countries. One of the main benefits
of using self-reported wellbeing is that we can see, from the data, how
much things like wealth and health really matter to people’s lives,
rather than assuming we know.</p>
<p>How significant is a 1-point change in life satisfaction? In
high-income countries, being depressed is associated with a 1.3-point
decrease in life satisfaction,22 being unemployed is about a 0.5-point
decrease,23 a doubling of income is about a 0.2-point increase,24 and
marriage is associated with a 0.3-point increase a year after getting
married.25</p>
<p>Quantifying impact in WELLBYs is a recent research area. It’s a
simple and powerful approach and we are not the only people to propose
or use</p>
<p><img src="_page_235_Picture_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>it. The WELLBY was proposed as an alternative or complement to
measures of health and wealth in <em>World Happiness Report 2021</em>,
26 and has been discussed in mainstream academia as a method for
evaluating public policy.27 In 2021, the WELLBY methodology was adopted
by the United Kingdom (UK) Treasury as an official way of evaluating the
impact of government policies.28</p>
<p>We see no good reason not to apply WELLBYs to charities: it gives us
a scientifically credible, evidence-based way to work out how much good
we do, per dollar, by giving to different charities. So, how can we
assess charity impact in WELLBYs, and what’s been found so far?</p>
<h2 id="a-review-of-the-current-literature"><strong>A review of the
current literature</strong></h2>
<p>In this section, we discuss and compare the previous work that has
analysed the cost-effectiveness of life-improving charities in WELLBYs.
We offer some context first before presenting a table of the results and
a few case studies to illustrate how the evaluations were done. Finally,
we present a figure indicating the differences in cost-effectiveness and
discuss how to interpret these results.</p>
<h4 id="context-for-wellby-charity-evaluation"><strong>Context for
WELLBY charity evaluation</strong></h4>
<p>Evaluations of charity cost-effectiveness in WELLBYs only started in
the last few years. The first ones we know of were in Plant (2019) and
the first explicitly couched in WELLBYs were all published in 2021: by
Frijters and Krekel, State of Life, and the Happier Lives Institute
(where the authors work).29</p>
<p>At the time of writing, we found 24 charity evaluations from four
evaluators:30</p>
<ul>
<li>State of Life: 3 charities</li>
<li>Pro Bono Economics: 3 charities</li>
<li>Happier Lives Institute: 14 charities</li>
<li>Krekel and colleagues: 4 charities</li>
</ul>
<p>The first three are organisations. (Christian) Krekel is an academic
who has produced estimates with different colleagues so, for simplicity,
we say “Krekel and colleagues”.31</p>
<p>At its simplest, a charity evaluation might look at the total amount
an organisation spends to provide a service, how many people it provides
that service to, and then estimate the average benefit per person
reached. So, if a charity spent $1 million, reached 50,000 people, and
they each got a 1 WELLBY benefit, that’s 50,000 WELLBYs for $1 million,
a cost-effectiveness of $1 million / 50,000 = $20 per WELLBY.</p>
<p>Getting sensible estimates for these numbers can be a
resource-intensive process. The charity evaluations we draw on usually
consist of a technical report at least as long as this chapter. We
summarise each evaluation in a few paragraphs in the online
appendix<strong>.</strong> For brevity and readability, we do not
describe every charity evaluation in the main text.</p>
<p>All the evaluations produce a similar <em>output</em>: a
cost-per-WELLBY figure for each charity (or estimates easily convertible
to these terms). However, they differ in terms of their <em>inputs</em>:
the evaluations are not all done in the same way. The main differences
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol type="1">
<li>The depth of the analyses and the quality and quantity of the
evidence used.32</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Modelling choices, such as adjusting for internal and external
validity, and whether researchers tried to include longer-term and
societal effects in addition to the short-term impacts on the direct
beneficiaries.<sup>33</sup></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>For cost-effectiveness estimates to be credible, they need good data
and analysis. If we want perfect data and analysis, we will be waiting
forever. The estimates we present below are informed by data, not
‘facts’, and we hope further work will refine them. Nevertheless, as the
alternative to explicit, quantitative estimates is to rely on intuitive
judgments, we see real value in producing and using estimates for
decision-making purposes.</p>
<p>We take the evaluators’ assessments at face value, rather than
critiquing or adjusting them. Further work could attempt to ‘harmonise’
the estimates, but this wasn’t essential to draw our main conclusion
that cost-effectiveness differs radically between charities.34 We do,
however, include our subjective assessments of the relevance of the
evidence and depth of analysis: these can be understood as indicating
uncertainty. These estimates will also need to be updated in the future.
They reflect the charities’ programmes at a particular point in time and
will naturally become less realistic as programmes and operating
conditions change.</p>

<p>With those caveats out of the way, we present our results. In Table

but we provide further details for interested readers in an

<p>In the following sections, we highlight one analysis from each
evaluator for illustrative purposes. A longer description of each
charity and its evaluation is provided in the online appendix. Some
readers may want to skip over these details to see the visual
comparisons of cost-effectiveness in the figures below – and return here
afterwards.</p>
<h2
id="psychotherapy-in-sub-saharan-africa-happier-lives-institute"><em>Psychotherapy
in Sub-Saharan Africa (Happier Lives Institute)</em></h2>
<p>StrongMinds36 (in Uganda and Zambia) and Friendship Bench37 (in
Zimbabwe) are two charities scaling access to basic mental healthcare in
Sub-Saharan Africa using lay practitioners to deliver psychotherapy to
people with depression or anxiety.38</p>
<p>To estimate the effect of these charities we combined evidence from
several sources. For the effect on the direct recipient, we drew on
three types of evidence.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we performed a systematic search and collected 84 randomised
control trials (RCTs) of psychotherapy delivered in low- and
middle-income countries.</li>
<li>Second, we used RCTs associated with the charities’ programmes (1
for StrongMinds and 4 for Friendship Bench).</li>
<li>Third, we used the monitoring and evaluation pre-post data collected
by the charities themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>We then combined the estimates from these different evidence sources
based on our judgement of the relative statistical uncertainty, quality,
and relevance of each estimate. To estimate the effect on other members
of the household, we combined data from six studies39 and adjusted them
for validity concerns (e.g., adjustments for publication bias40).</p>
<p><img src="_page_239_Picture_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Based on these evidence sources and our methodology, we estimated an
overall effect of 0.80 WELLBYs for Friendship Bench and 1.80 WELLBYs for
StrongMinds per person treated (including the effects over time and the
impact on the beneficiary’s household). The cost of these programmes is
very low as they work in lowincome countries and use trained volunteers.
The cost to treat an individual for therapy is $17 through Friendship
Bench and $45 for StrongMinds. This results in a cost per WELLBY of $21
for Friendship Bench and $25 for StrongMinds. We consider this an
in-depth analysis.</p>
<h4 id="parkrun-state-of-life"><em>Parkrun (State of Life)</em></h4>
<p>Parkrun41 is a UK charity that supports free community runs delivered
by volunteers every weekend. State of Life estimates its effects using
correlational evidence.42 First, they use a larger, but less relevant,
dataset from the UK (n ≈ 60,000) that shows the relationship between
running, volunteering, and wellbeing more broadly. Second, they use a
longitudinal study that followed participants before and after they
participated in a Parkrun event in the UK (n = 576).</p>
<p>They apply these effects to the total number of walks or runs
(8,590,393) and volunteering for Parkrun instances (974,255) in 2019
(see their Table 8 and Approach 3). They then discount the effects in
both cases to account for the fact they are missing a randomly assigned
control group and so can’t be sure how much of the correlation is due to
the effect of related activities.</p>
<p>They did not provide a central estimate between the two estimates, so
we took the liberty of averaging them together. The result is Parkrun
producing 27,651 WELLBYs in 2019. The total operational cost of Parkrun
in 2019 was £4.5 million, resulting in a cost per WELLBY of £165
($206).43 We consider this analysis to be of medium depth.</p>
<h4 id="action-for-happiness-frijters-and-krekel"><em>Action for
Happiness (Frijters and Krekel)</em></h4>
<p>Action for Happiness44 is a charity that delivers courses and
promotes wellbeing skills. The analysis45 is based on a randomised
control trial which found that a six-week course teaching wellbeing
skills raised life satisfaction by around 1 point on a 0-10 scale at the
two-month follow-up.</p>
<p>To get the total effects over time the authors assumed the effects
remained constant for a year before dropping off completely. They used
the course data that suggests it costs £80 per participant and assumed
these costs and randomised control trial results are representative of
the charity in general. Overall, Action for Happiness has a cost per
WELLBY of £80 (or $100).46</p>
<p>We consider this to be a shallow analysis. Note that Action for
Happiness has since switched</p>
<p>from an in-person to a virtual model, meaning the evidence is now
less relevant to the delivery in practice. We are uncertain how this
would change its cost-effectiveness.</p>
<h4 id="football-beyond-borders-pro-bono-economics"><em>Football Beyond
Borders (Pro Bono Economics)</em></h4>
<p>Football Beyond Borders47 is a UK charity dedicated to improving
school outcomes for students through a combination of tutoring with a
trusted adult, football practice, and therapeutic support. Their
cost-effectiveness was evaluated by Pro Bono Economics.48</p>
<p>The study was not a randomised control trial, but they used a matched
control method and a difference-in-difference estimator, which is better
than relying on pre-post changes. 153 Football Beyond Borders
participants were statistically matched with individuals drawn from the
Manchester BeeWell dataset. They found that participants’ wellbeing
improved by 0.15 points on a 0–10 life-satisfaction scale49 and assumed
the effects lasted for one year.</p>
<p>During the 2022–23 school year, 2,401 students benefited from the
Football Beyond Borders programme, representing a 360 WELLBY benefit. It
cost £2.5 million to run the programme. This results in a cost of £6,953
($8,691)50 per WELLBY. We consider this a medium-depth analysis.</p>
<h4 id="results-and-interpretation"><strong>Results and
interpretation</strong></h4>
<h4 id="distribution-of-cost-effectiveness"><em>Distribution of
cost-effectiveness</em></h4>
<p>In Figure 8.1, we present the cost-effectiveness estimates for 19 of
the 24 analyses.51 We identify the different evaluators with unique
colours and indicate the depth of analysis with different circle sizes.
We use report length as a proxy for depth: in-depth evaluations have
multiple analyses that could each be a separate report, medium-depth
evaluations have a standalone report, and shallow evaluations are rough,
brief analyses that are not presented in standalone reports.</p>
<p>We do not include confidence intervals around the central estimate –
which is a typical way of representing uncertainty – for reasons
explained in an endnote.52</p>
<p><img src="_page_241_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>The figure shows that the cost-effectiveness of the charities varies
substantially from $9 to $8,691 per WELLBY – a 942 fold difference in
cost-effectiveness. In Figure 8.2, we present the same results, but this
time in <em>WELLBYs per $1,000</em>, rather than <em>cost per
WELLBY</em>. This is the same information, presented differently. The
advantage of showing WELLBYs per $1,000 is that it does not compress the
top options in the way cost per WELLBY did above. This presentation
shows how much more cost-effective the top options are compared to the
middle and bottom ones.</p>
<h3 id="explaining-the-distribution"><em>Explaining the
distribution</em></h3>
<p>These estimates show that charities differ radically in how much
happiness they create per dollar.</p>
<p>Why is this? The natural explanation is that the top charities are
providing cheap and impactful interventions in low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs). In contrast, the less cost-effective charities are
working in high-income countries in ways that are much more
expensive.</p>
<p>This difference is starkly presented in Figure 8.3. The top five
charities in our sample53 all operate in LMICs and have an average cost
per WELLBY of $18. This is 142 times more cost-effective than the seven
UK charities in our sample54 which have an average cost per WELLBY of
$2,553.55 However, those seven charities are still cost-effective in the
UK context, where governmental guidelines value 1 WELLBY at
£13,000.56</p>
<p><img src="_page_242_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_242_Figure_2.jpeg" /></p>
<p><img src="_page_243_Figure_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>That said, could the differences in cost-effectiveness be due to some
evaluators being more conservative or generous in their analysis than
others? At first glance, this may seem like an important factor since
the differences in average cost-effectiveness across evaluators are also
substantial (see Figure 8.4).</p>
<p>There are differences in methodology that may explain some of the
variation we see between evaluators. We discuss these in more detail in
the online appendix but highlight the more important points below.</p>
<ul>
<li><ol type="1">
<li>Only a few evaluations have been done per evaluator: four or less
for State of Life, Pro Bono Economics, and Krekel and colleagues, and
just over 10 for the Happier Lives Institute (HLI). As these are such
small samples, a single charity evaluation can have a large impact on
the average.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The evaluators have different sampling processes. State of Life, Pro
Bono Economics, and Krekel and colleagues are, to a large extent,
analysing UK charities that they were asked to analyse or which were
convenient to analyse. In contrast, HLI explicitly set out to look for
the most cost-effective charities and focuses on charities working in
lowincome countries.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>It seems reasonable to assume each evaluator is using similar levels
of conservatism over time. The main result – charity cost-effectiveness
differs substantially – is true even if we look within each evaluator.
For the Happier Lives Institute, the best charity is 14x more
cost-effective than the least cost-effective charity; for State of Life
it’s 13x; for Krekel and colleagues it’s 44x; and for Pro Bono Economics
it’s 5x. If charity cost-effectiveness differs considerably
<em>within</em> each evaluator, it is unsurprising that
cost-effectiveness differs considerably <em>between</em> evaluators with
different sampling methods.</p>
<p>A final reason to be reassured comes from analogous WELLBY analyses
for policies which also find that the cost-effectiveness of policy
initiatives varies to a large degree – even more so than the charities
discussed here.57 On the low end, some policies, such as
government-funded psychotherapy in the UK, are estimated to have a
<em>negative</em> cost per WELLBY as they save the government money.58
On the higher end, some policies appear highly ineffective. For example,
extending the winter fuel allowance in the UK to help older people cover
heating costs (a policy the Labour party ended while we were writing
this) is estimated to cost $100,000 per WELLBY. In summary, we find that
charities differ substantially in their impact per dollar, with some
hundreds of times better than others. This finding is in sharp contrast
to the seemingly common but mistaken belief that the best charities are
less than two times better than average charities.59</p>
<h2 id="whats-missing-from-the-sample"><strong>What’s missing from the
sample?</strong></h2>
<p>Our review has two obvious gaps. First, it doesn’t include any large
and well-known NGOs, such as Oxfam or Save the Children. Second, it
doesn’t include typical acts of charity, like giving to the homeless
within one’s own country. How do these compare to the charities in our
sample? In this section, we try to answer that question but we’re unable
to draw strong conclusions and more work is needed.</p>
<h4 id="multi-armed-ngos"><strong>Multi-armed NGOS</strong></h4>
<p>The immediate challenge with evaluating large charities is that they
often run tens, even hundreds, of programmes. We call these types of
charities ‘MANGOs’, standing for ‘multi-armed NGOs’. An example of a
MANGO is Oxfam. In 2023, it reported running 727 programmes across
diverse areas such as economic and gender justice, climate action, and
humanitarian response.60</p>
<p>The charities in our sample only run a single (or a few) programmes.
Assessing one programme carefully in terms of WELLBYs per dollar is a
considerable task. Assessing a MANGO requires an evaluation of every
individual programme and weighing them by budget allocation to calculate
average cost-effectiveness. This is out of scope. The alternative would
be guesswork, which would not be informative. Leaving aside the focus of
WELLBYs per dollar, it is very hard to find cost-effectiveness
assessments by charities of any kind. Out of the largest 100 charities
in the UK,61 we can only provide a ballpark costeffectiveness estimate
for two, and this is because they have a clear primary output.</p>
<p>The Royal National Lifeboat Institute (RNLI) is a UK charity that
rescues people in danger at sea. In 2023, they report saving a total of
269 people62 and a total expenditure of £242.6m63 ($303.3m).64</p>
<p>These figures imply a cost of $902k per life saved. We estimate that
each life they save produces an average of 177 WELLBYs.65 This results
in a cost per WELLBY of $6,386, not accounting for any psychological
benefits for the wider population.<sup>66</sup></p>
<p>The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association spent around £74m on guide
dogs in 202367 and reported that they formed 469 new guide dog
partnerships. We estimate, based on three limited studies, that having a
guide dog leads to a 0.7-point increase in life satisfaction which is a
very large effect per year.68 Guide dogs work for seven years on
average.69 Therefore, we estimate that one extra guide dog leads to 4.83
WELLBYs (counting just the impact on humans). This means the total
impact in 2023 was 2,266 WELLBYs, costing $40,767 per WELLBY.</p>
<p>While these two organisations are clearly making a difference to
people’s lives, our very shallow estimates suggest they are
substantially less cost-effective than the top charities in our sample
which cost around $18 per WELLBY.</p>
<p>Our second concern about MANGOs – on top of the assessment challenge
– is the ‘dilution effect’. A MANGO’s cost-effectiveness will be the
combined cost-effectiveness of its individual programmes. If an
organisation has one very cost-effective programme, adding a low
costeffectiveness programme will <em>reduce</em> its average impact per
dollar. To remain as cost-effective, it has to add a programme that is
just as efficient. For a MANGO to be more cost-effective than the top
charities in our sample, their average (budget-weighted) programme would
need to be as good as the best single programme NGOs. This means some of
their programmes need to be better than anything we’ve observed so far.
This isn’t impossible, but it seems unlikely. As a result, we expect
MANGOs to be less cost-effective than charities that do one thing
well.</p>
<p><em>By reallocating resources from the least to the most impactful
options, MANGOs could make a far greater difference.</em></p>
<p><img src="_page_245_Picture_1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Considering the funding allocated to MANGOs and how little is known
about their cost-effectiveness, we encourage further work on this by
researchers and the charities themselves. Indeed, we hope MANGOs see the
value of the WELLBY approach. It makes it possible to compare otherwise
incomparable programmes. This means charities can see what works well
and what does not. By reallocating resources from the least to the most
impactful options, MANGOs could make a far greater difference.</p>
<h4 id="homelessness-interventions"><strong>Homelessness
interventions</strong></h4>
<p>As well as donating to large, well-known charities, many people
donate to small, local causes or even individuals. When people think of
‘charity’, we expect that helping the poor and homeless in their local
area is one of the first things that comes to mind.70 For the purposes
of comparison, we briefly try to estimate the impact of helping the
homeless using two analyses of homelessness interventions.</p>
<p>Frijters and Krekel (2021) estimate, based on an RCT, that providing
“housing first” for people experiencing homelessness is reasonably
effective, providing 0.67 WELLBYs per person.71 However, they also found
it was very expensive, costing around $23k per person. Thus, they
concluded that providing a housing first intervention costs $35k per
WELLBY,72 which is about 2,000 times less cost-effective than the top
charities in our sample.</p>
<p>However, economic theory suggests that cash is (typically) better as
it allows you to buy whatever you want.73 We found one study looking at
cash transfers to homeless people living in Vancouver, Canada.74 This
RCT looked at unconditional, lump-sum cash transfers of 7,500 CAD (6,637
USD). Based on the results of the trial, we model that the impact lasts
for two years, leading to an overall effect of 0.33 WELLBYs costing
$6,667 per person.75 This leads to a cost per WELLBY of $19,994. This is
more promising than ‘housing first’, but still hundreds of times less
impactful per dollar than the best-performing alternatives.</p>
<p>An obvious limitation of our estimates is the exclusion of possible
‘spillover’ benefits, for</p>
<p><em>These estimates provide at least some evidence to suggest that a
very common charitable act, helping the homeless, is difficult to do
cost-effectively.</em></p>
<p>instance, that homeless people, once housed, require fewer emergency
services.76 Nevertheless, we think these estimates provide at least some
evidence to suggest that a very common charitable act, helping the
homeless, is difficult to do cost-effectively.77</p>
<h2 id="questions-and-objections"><strong>Questions and
objections</strong></h2>
<p>In this section, we anticipate some questions and concerns that we
haven’t addressed so far and provide brief responses. We end with some
concluding remarks for donors and researchers.</p>
<h4 id="how-much-should-i-give"><strong>How much should I
give?</strong></h4>
<p>As a rule of thumb, the right amount to give is the largest amount
that <em>you can sustain</em>. Peter Singer (the originator of the
Shallow Pond thought experiment) proposes a stepped scale. It starts at
1% for those earning $40k-$80k, is 5% between $80k-$120k, and eventually
rises to 50% for those earning over $50m.78</p>
<h4 id="will-giving-make-me-happier"><strong>Will giving make me
happier?</strong></h4>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, the evidence indicates it does.79 However,
this is presumably only up to a limit. We know of no research on the
tipping point of when giving reduces our wellbeing.</p>
<h4 id="what-about-causes-you-havent-discussed"><strong>What about
causes you haven’t discussed?</strong></h4>
<p>WELLBY cost-effectiveness allows us to shine a bright, scientifically
credible, and evidence-based light in a narrow spot: the topics where we
have good self-reported wellbeing data. This is both a strength and a
limitation. Our exclusion of charities from other areas, such as climate
change and animal welfare, doesn’t mean those topics have no value; only
that the more we want to go</p>
<p>beyond the existing evidence, the more we have to peer into the
darkness and speculate. For instance, there is no clear theoretical
problem with applying the WELLBY approach to climate change
interventions – at base, it involves estimating the impacts on wellbeing
now versus wellbeing later – but any analysis will rest heavily on
assumptions about long-term effects.80 We hope that readers will be
interested in the evidence we’ve assembled here, but not especially
interested in our opinions, which is why we don’t extend the analysis
beyond the available data.</p>
<h2
id="i-already-give-to-insert-charity.-is-it-wrong-to-switch-my-donations-to-a-more-cost-effective-charity"><strong>I
already give to [insert charity]. Is it wrong to switch my donations to
a more cost-effective charity?</strong></h2>
<p>In short: no. Some people are understandably reluctant to switch
because it feels like they are letting down the organisation they’ve
been supporting and the people it benefits. But if you think an
alternative charity will do more good per dollar, it helps to keep in
mind the greater total benefit you’ll cause by supporting that
alternative.</p>
<h4 id="should-i-split-my-donations"><strong>Should I split my
donations?</strong></h4>
<p>A simple answer is that, if you want to maximise your impact, you
should only give to the charity you think is most cost-effective.
However, that organisation could reach ‘diminishing marginal returns’.81
For instance, their budget gets filled and they can’t usefully spend the
money, so they stop being as cost-effective. At that point, you should
switch to the next best option, and so on. This implies small donors
shouldn’t switch, but perhaps large donors should as they have enough
money to fill one organisation’s budget and then move to the next.82</p>
<p>However, this simple answer isn’t very satisfying. One problem is
that it’s often very hard to compare the options. For instance, you
might care about helping people today and helping future generations (or
helping globally and helping locally, and so on). Lots of us have the
intuition we don’t really know how to compare these, but we want to do
<em>something</em> about both. Faced with this problem, you might have a
current people ‘bucket’ and a future generations ‘bucket’, then somehow
split your budget</p>
<p>between these, and then try to identify the best thing(s) in each.
The authors share the intuition that this is the right approach, but
it’s unclear how to justify it or make the details precise, and very
little seems to have been written on it in philosophy.83</p>
<p>Another issue is that many people have a strong desire to split.
Perhaps you’re not motivated to give everything to a
‘boring-but-effective’ charity (even if you think that would make the
most difference) and you want to give something to a cause that tugs on
your heartstrings. In this case, it’s clearly better to split your
donations, rather than give nothing. Perhaps you give 80% to the
boring-but-effective option and 20% to your ‘heartstrings’ project to
stay motivated. Again, the best giving is sustainable.</p>
<h4 id="what-about-inequality"><strong>What about
inequality?</strong></h4>
<p>Lots of people have the intuition that it’s more important to
increase the happiness of someone who’s at 3/10 than someone who’s at
8/10, even if the costs and all other factors are the same. This can be
understood as a concern for equality, not merely efficiency. None of the
estimates in our sample account for equality: they treat a 1-point
increase as having the same value for both the 3/10 and the 8/10
person.84</p>
<p>Further work could examine this, but we don’t think accounting for
equality would change the rankings. The most cost-effective charities
tend to target people with low happiness anyway – what makes them so
efficient is that they address serious problems. For instance,
Strong-Minds and Friendship Bench help depressed people in low-income
countries, some of the worst-off people on the planet. In contrast, the
less cost-effective options in the sample are often targeting better-off
people in a wealthy country. So, adding in an equality factor would
probably exaggerate the differences, making the most cost-effective
options look more valuable, rather than reverse the results.</p>
<h2 id="concluding-remarks"><strong>Concluding remarks</strong></h2>
<h4 id="for-donors"><strong>For donors</strong></h4>
<p>The main takeaway for donors is that charities vary hugely in terms
of cost-effectiveness. By picking carefully, we can have vastly more
impact on happiness for the same monetary cost. We have to emphasise how
extraordinary the differences in charity cost-effectiveness are. When we
are buying items for ourselves we are typically delighted when there’s a
sale and we discover we can get 20% more for our money. But if you want
to buy happiness <em>for other people</em>, you can potentially get
100x, or more, by donating to the most cost-effective charities. It
would be like a store running a secret campaign where you spend $10 on a
phone charger and receive a complimentary $1,000 laptop.</p>
<p>Research on WELLBY cost-effectiveness is in its early days, for both
policies and charities. We hope more research will be done, even better
charities will be revealed, that the estimates we have presented will be
updated, and therefore this chapter will quickly become outdated.</p>
<p>For those wanting to see the latest findings and recommendations, we
advise you to visit www. happierlivesinstitute.org which acts as a
living literature review for the cost-effectiveness of (top)
charities.</p>
<p>From a global and historical perspective, you are probably much
wealthier than you realise. The difference you can make to people’s
happiness globally is probably far greater than you ever thought – if
you follow the evidence and support the best charities. We often want to
help other people and make the world better, but feel like there’s
nothing we can do. We hope we’ve shown that’s not true. We can do a
great deal. It’s up to each of us to decide what to do.</p>
<h4 id="for-researchers"><strong>For researchers</strong></h4>
<p>This chapter has only scratched the surface of applying wellbeing
cost-effectiveness analysis to maximising philanthropic returns. There
are many ways for researchers to contribute to this new, and important
field.</p>
<p>First and foremost, we need more wellbeing cost-effectiveness
analyses in general. We know so little about the huge variety of things
that could be funded or done. Particularly, we need more analyses to be
published in academia to stress test the methodology and develop best
practices.</p>
<p>In our research so far, we have found there’s often information on
the direct, immediate impact on recipients, but very sparse data on all
the other aspects. There is practically no information on household
spillovers. This is crucial given that in some cases, as we have
argued,85 household members as a whole will get a greater total benefit
than the direct recipient.</p>
<p>Evidence on the duration of benefits is also often missing. Again, it
seems very plausible that some interventions will last much longer than
others, so long-term data will have a large influence on effectiveness
estimates.86</p>
<p>Lastly, the benefits of some interventions are inherently more
difficult to quantify because they have a particularly long-term or
diffuse group of beneficiaries. Examples of this include climate
change,87 children (who can’t report their wellbeing reliably),88
education,89 cultural activities,90 research,91 and religious
activities.92 However, even for these, we believe that it is possible to
use existing evidence to get a better sense of their effect on
wellbeing.</p>
<p>There are many other methodological questions, such as empirical and
philosophical issues relating to extending versus improving lives,93 or
how to trade-off between internal and external validity.94</p>
<p>We believe these are all rich veins of inquiry waiting to be mined.
Wellbeing cost-effectiveness is an unusual area. Barely any work has
been done but it has huge and direct practical implications. We hope
researchers take up the challenge and use their skills to make a
difference.</p>

<li>18 We use ‘happiness’ and ‘wellbeing’ as synonyms here and
throughout. This is, admittedly, an abuse of terminology, though not one
we expect readers to mind. In philosophy, ‘wellbeing’ refers to what
makes life ultimately good for us. Philosophers have three accounts of
wellbeing. The first is</li>
</ul>
<p>hedonism, on which wellbeing consists in happiness (a positive
balance of enjoyment over suffering). The second are desire theories, on
which wellbeing consists in having one’s desires satisfied. The third is
the objective list, which claims there can be things that make a
person’s life go better which are neither pleasurable to nor desired by
them. Classic items for the objective list include success, friendship,
knowledge, and virtuous behaviour. Hence, wellbeing refers to happiness
only on one of these accounts. That said, the debate amongst
philosophers is generally about whether happiness is the only thing that
matters for our wellbeing. Those holding desire theory or objective
lists accounts will tend to say that happiness matters for wellbeing
somehow, either because we desire happiness, or because it is one of the
goods that matter intrinsically. A view of wellbeing that held that our
experiences, including suffering, did not matter in any way would be a
peculiar, implausible view of wellbeing. We direct readers to Crisp
(2021) for the best introduction to the topic; it is open access.</p>

<li><p>30 As most of this work is not published in academic journals, we
generally found these evaluations by word of mouth. While it’s possible
we have missed something, the world of WELLBY research is small (all of
the researchers seem to be associated with UK organisations) so we don’t
think this is a large concern.</p></li>
<li><p>31 Frijters and Krekel (2021); Krekel et al. (2024).</p></li>
<li><p>32 It is widely accepted that there is a ‘hierarchy of evidence’,
where research that uses evidence that is higher up is considered more
reliable and better at demonstrating causality than those which use data
from further down. At the top of the hierarchy are studies of groups of
causal studies (meta-analyses), then singular causal studies, then
groups of studies with non-causal methods, etc. One difference between
the charity evaluations in our dataset is that they do not all rely on
evidence at the same level of the hierarchy. Beyond the quantity of
studies and whether they demonstrate causality or not, academics often
use frameworks like ‘GRADE’ which assess the quality and relevance of
study to whatever question is at hand. See</p></li>
<li><p>Guyatt et al. (2011) for a discussion of the role of indirectness
in GRADE assessments and Guyatt et al. (2008) or Siemieniuk and Guyatt
(n.d.) for more about GRADE generally.</p></li>
<li><p>33 The estimates here generally focus on directly-measurable
improvements to quality of life over a few years or less. It’s possible,
in principle, to extend the WELLBY approach to incorporate, for
instance, (A) interventions with very long-run, indirect effects, such
as those from climate policy, or (B) comparing life-improving and
life-extending interventions. But these end up being far more
speculative. For (A) there’s an empirical challenge about predicting the
future. For (B) there are difficult philosophical questions, such as
when a life has negative wellbeing, that apply whatever measure of
impact is used. See Plant et al. (2022) for a discussion of the
empirical and philosophical difficulties with comparing the wellbeing
value of improving and extending lives. We lack the space to do justice
to these more complex topics here, so we restrict our attention to the
most data-based ‘apples-to-apples’ comparisons.</p></li>
<li><p>34 This conclusion would only be under threat if there was an
unlikely pattern of error: all the more cost-effective charities were
too high, all the less cost-effective charities were too low, and
coincidentally the correct estimates yield nearly identical
cost-effectiveness numbers. As we say later, the differences in
cost-effectiveness is most easily explained by what the charities do and
where they work.</p></li>
<li><p>35 Each row in the table represents a charity evaluation. It
summarises what the charity does, who evaluated it, and its
cost-effectiveness, expressed as cost per WELLBY.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>duration</strong> column reflects how many years the
effect of the intervention is expected to last.</p>
<p>The <strong>total sample</strong> refers to the number of
participants included in the analysis. The <strong>total
studies</strong> column shows the number of datasets or interventions
analysed. This is not always the same as the number of published papers
because a single intervention might appear in multiple papers (e.g.,
follow-ups). Analyses often rely on diverse evidence sources that are
sometimes difficult to quantify. We aimed to ensure consistency in how
these totals are reported across charity evaluations.</p>
<p>We also provide brief assessments of the <strong>causality</strong>
of the evidence. Evidence is ranked on a hierarchy, with meta-analyses
of randomised control trials (RCTs) being the most robust and
associative studies being the least. Methods such as matched groups with
difference-indifference fall somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Similarly, we offer brief assessments of the
<strong>relevance</strong> of the evidence to the specific charity being
evaluated. When evidence is rated as highly relevant, it often comes
directly from studies of the charity’s own participants. Lower relevance
ratings apply when the evidence is drawn from studies of similar
interventions (e.g., psychotherapy) rather than the specific
charity.</p>
<p>Finally, we provide brief assessments of how
<strong>in-depth</strong> the analysis is. These assessments are
relative. In this case, we view report length as a proxy for depth.
In-depth evaluations may have multiple analyses that could each be a
separate report, medium depth evaluations provide a standalone analyses,
and shallow depth evaluations are rough, brief analyses that are not
presented in standalone reports.</p>

<li><p>38 McGuire et al. (2024b).</p></li>
<li><p>39 Note that there is no spillover data directly related to the
charities programme. We use wider sources of data to estimate a
spillover ratio (5 RCTs and 1 controlled trial). Namely, we estimate
that non-recipient members of the household experience 16% of the
wellbeing benefit that the psychotherapy recipient experiences. We apply
this to the average household in the countries where these charities
operate, which is between 3 and 4 other household members.</p></li>
<li><p>40 We discounted this estimate for a range of internal validity
(i.e., is the data accurate) and external validity (i.e., does the data
we use generalise to the case we are estimating) concerns. For example,
for internal validity, we multiply the effect by 0.69 (a 31% discount)
for publication bias. For example, for external validity, we multiply
the effect by 0.90 (a 10% discount) for the use of lay therapists. The
charities rely on lay deliverers of manualised psychotherapy instead of
experts because there are too few experts in low-income countries. This
is often called ‘task-shifting’. While our modelling suggests it reduces
the effect a little bit, it also allows for a lot more people to be
treated and at lower costs; hence, it improves the cost-effectiveness of
the charities.</p></li>

They found an improvement of 2.4 points on the SWEMWBS measure of mental
wellbeing, which they convert at a 0.24 rate to life satisfaction on a
0–10 scale; namely, an effect of 0.576. They assume benefits only occur
for the ‘at risk’ children. They adjust the impact by the proportion of
‘at risk’ student in the total sample of Football Beyond Borders in the

<li><p>52 We do not include confidence intervals for two reasons. One is
that the evaluations themselves often don’t include them. The other,
more conceptual issue, is that confidence intervals only capture
statistical uncertainty. There are other, harder-to-quantify
uncertainties to pay attention to. For example, is the quality of the
data sufficient to determine a causal effect? Is the data relevant to
the context being evaluated? Has the analysis considered all the
relevant parameters? Hence, providing confidence intervals would create
false precision.</p></li>

<li><p>55 Note that averaging ratios introduces a mathematical
inconsistency: the average ‘cost per WELLBY’ does not necessarily align
with the inverse of the average ‘WELLBYs created per $1,000 donated.’
This discrepancy arises because the average of a ratio is not equivalent
to the ratio of averages when values vary across analyses. As a result,
the direction of calculation can yield different outcomes. These
comparisons are intended for illustrative purposes rather than precise
calculations.</p></li>

<li><p>58 Policies, unlike charities, can have zero cost per WELLBY if
they increase future tax revenues, and thus have no net cost to
governments over the long run.</p></li>
<li><p>59 Caviola et al. (2020). This raises a puzzle: if some charities
are so much better than others, why would people think they are all
about as good? Schubert and Caviola (2024, pp 33) propose the underlying
cause is that donors are not motivated by efficiency and often lack good
metrics to compare charities’ impact. They contrast this to consumer
goods. We want good deals for ourselves and can tell if we’re getting
them, so competitive pressures mean that overpriced goods are driven out
of the market, and companies that produce better goods can charge more
for them. Hence for consumer goods, it is reasonable to expect equally
priced products are equally good. As we are used to buying goods for
ourselves, it’s natural for donors to (mistakenly) apply the same
thinking to charities.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Schubert and Caviloa (2024, pp 68) also point to an illustrative
disanalogy between donations and investments. Investors are generally
rational and seeking the best returns for themselves, so share prices
approximate companies’ true value – which is why it is difficult to
‘beat the market’. In contrast, because so few donors are seeking to
maximise their philanthropic returns, it should be relatively easy for
impact-minded donors to beat the <em>philanthropic</em> market and have
outsized returns. We say ‘relatively easy’ as there <em>are</em>
impact-minded donors, and occasionally there is a scramble to fund the
best charities – just as there is to invest in the most promising
companies – such that you can’t give to the best options because their
budgets are full.</p>

that don’t directly use its service, but <em>could</em> do – the feeling

estimate the size of this benefit would be very speculative. Further,
many charities also have a “it’s good to know it’s there if you need it”
factor, so it’s not obvious how accounting for this factor would change
the numbers across the board. Hence, we don’t try to account for it
here. We thank the editors for drawing this issue to our

<li><p>77 The authors feel the intuitive pull of doing something to help
those in our local communities - but not of allocating the lion’s share
of our (spare) resources here if there are better ways to help people.
See the comments on donation splitting later.</p></li>
<li><p>78 Singer (2009, p. 221).</p></li>
<li><p>79 See Aknin et al. (2020) and Aknin et al. (2022) for
preregistered reports on the personal wellbeing benefits of
beneficence.</p></li>
<li><p>80 For animal welfare, it’s not obvious what we would compare the
self-reported wellbeing scores of humans to, or how to form an
evidence-based rate of exchange.</p></li>
<li><p>81 None of the estimates above by us or the other researchers –
have tried to account for diminishing marginal returns. This is both
because it’s difficult to do so and it’s unusual for organisations to
suddenly be offered far more money than they can spend.</p></li>
<li><p>82 See Snowden (2019) for elucidation of the standard argument on
why giving to one charity maximises expected utility, absent concerns
about diminishing marginal returns.</p></li>
<li><p>83 For instance, in a blog post, Karnofsky (2016) endorses
‘worldview diversification’, that is, “putting significant resources
behind each worldview that [one finds] highly plausible” but does not
provide a fully-developed argument for this; keys terms, such as
‘worldview’ and ‘strong uncertainty’ are undefined. Kaczmarek, Lloyd and
Plant (forthcoming) observe that none of the standard philosophical
theories of <em>moral</em> uncertainty provide independent grounds for
diversification (moral uncertainty is distinct from empirical
uncertainty). They offer a novel, bargainingbased theory of moral
uncertainty, the ‘moral marketplace’,</p></li>
<li><p>on which diversification is <em>sometimes</em> appropriate. We
know of no other work that argues, on grounds of moral uncertainty, that
diversification is ever appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p>84 The philosophical topic here is the ethics of aggregation,
sometimes known as distributional ethics. The implicit approach taken in
WELLBY cost-effectiveness is an additive aggregation function, where
each 1-point change has the same value, regardless of who accrues it or
how well-off they are (an additive aggregation function is necessary but
not sufficient for utilitarianism). There are alternative options here,
e.g., prioritarian or egalitarian functions, both of which can capture
the intuition it’s better to help the worse off, even if the change in
total wellbeing is the same. See Holtug (2015) and reference therein for
discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>85 See McGuire et al. (2022).</p></li>
<li><p>86 See McGuire et al. (2024a) Section 4.1 for a
discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>87 We did not find evidence establishing a link between global
carbon dioxide emissions and subjective wellbeing. However, the
consequences of climate change have a clear relationship to mental
wellbeing. For example, increases in ambient temperature are related to
lower wellbeing (Liu et al., 2021; Noelke et al. 2016), hurricane risk
is related to lower life satisfaction (Berlemann, 2016), and storms and
floods also are related to lower wellbeing (Sekulova &amp; van den
Bergh, 2016; von Möllendorff &amp; Hirschfeld, 2016).</p></li>
<li><p>88 For more discussion of this see Little and Parkes (2024),
McGuire et al. (2024b), and McGuire et al. (2024d).</p></li>
<li><p>89 While the correlational relationship between years of
education and mental wellbeing is positive (Bücker et al., 2018; Clark
et al., 2018), the causal evidence is more mixed with some studies
finding positive effects (Chevalier and Feinstein, 2006; Oreopoulos,
2007; Oreopoulos &amp; Salvanes, 2011; Powdthavee et al., 2013) other
null (Avendano et al., 2020; Dahmann &amp; Schnitzlein, 2019; Davies et
al., 2019; Viinikainen et al., 2018) or in some cases a negative effect
(Courtin et al. 2019).</p></li>
<li><p>90 Frijters and Krekel (2021) evaluate the wellbeing
costeffectiveness of two cultural programmes from a policy perspective:
the city of culture programme in the UK and the London
Olympics.</p></li>
<li><p>91 This isn’t true for other outcomes, which gives some reason
for hope. Several studies find a high ROI for research (Jones &amp;
Summers, 2020; Kremer et al., 2021; Pardey et al., 2016). Unger et
al. (2023) is optimistic about the cost-effectiveness of cancer research
on DALYs, estimating it costs $326 per year of life gained through
investment in research.</p></li>
<li><p>92 Zotti et al. (2016) estimates that, in the UK, the causal
effect of being religious is around 0.03 points on a 0–10
life-satisfaction scale.</p></li>
<li><p>93 See Plant et al. (2022) for a discussion of the challenges in
comparing the wellbeing value of improving and extending lives.</p></li>
<li><p>94 See McGuire et al. (2024a, Section 5) for an extensive
example.</p></li>
